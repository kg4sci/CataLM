Afterward, H2 and CH4 (10 sccm each) were introduced into the chamber as the precursor of VG. Then, VG grew under plasma irradiation for 10?min before the chamber was evacuated again to eliminate all of the gas precursors.

The starting Cu solution contained Cu(acac)2, oleylamine (OAm), and diphenyl ether (DPE). A Schlenk line was used to evacuate the flask and to introduce CO gas. The temperature was slowly ramped to 220? ～C (1.6? ～C min?1) and held for 2 h. The vessel was then cooled to 30? ～C. A portion of the NPs, labeled as CuCore, was taken at this point for characterization. For the formation of Cu@Ag NPs, a solution of AgOCOCF3 dissolved in OAm was slowly injected (1?mg Ag h?1) to the CuCore suspension at 30?～C while CO was flowing. The injection lasted 10 h and the mixture was stirred for an additional 12 h to ensure uniform growth of the Ag-enriched shell.[69,70] The CuCore and Cu@Ag NPs were collected by centrifugation, washed with hexane and methanol, and dispersed in hexane for further use. Figure? 1b is a proposed atomic scheme for the formation of the Cu@Ag NPs through the process outlined in Figure?1a. Figure?2 analyzes the ultraviolet-visible (UV每vis) absorption spectra of the Cu@Ag NPs after different durations of time for the addition of silver using the characteristic UV每vis peaks for Cu (580? nm) and Ag (410? nm). The Ag peak, which was initially absent, appeared after the reaction for 3 h, and significantly increased after 10 h. This observation suggests an increase in the thickness of the Ag-enriched shell during the reaction process. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images show the particles uniformly grew from the 6.5?nm CuCore NPs (Figure?3a) to form Cu@Ag"

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Preparation of Cu Nanoparticles (CuCore): The synthesis of NPs used in these experiments was modified from multiple sources.[64,73,74,77,78] The growth of the Cu NPs was achieved in a single pot under a CO gas environment. The details of the original designs were reported elsewhere.[64,74] The schematic for the typical synthesis is provided in Figure?1a. In a standard procedure, Cu(acac)2 (16?mg) was dissolved in OAm (9?mL) in a three-neck flask. DPE was added at a concentration of 120 米m. The resulting turquoise-blue solution was placed in an oil bath at 30?～C and continuously stirred during the following steps. A Schlenk line was purged using Ar gas and applied vacuum with a vacuum pump (Edwards, RV12). Before switching to Ar, the line was held under vacuum for 5? min to remove oxygen gas from the system. This process was repeated six times. Carbon monoxide gas was then introduced at a flow rate of 90 sccm. Caution: CO gas is toxic and should be handled with extra care in a well-vented chemical hood equipped with a CO detector. The temperature was maintained at 30?～C for 30?min, followed by being heated at a ramp rate of 1.6?～C min?1 to 220?～C using an oil bath. The color of the solution changed from transparent blue-green to yellow to reddish-brown during heating. The temperature of the vessel was kept at 220?～C for 2 h to ensure the completion of the reaction. Afterwards, the vessel was removed from the oil bath, allowed to cool naturally in about 1.5 h, and then placed in a second oil bath at 30? ～C, all while flowing CO. A portion of the NPs, labeled as CuCore, was taken at this point for characterization. The effects of the concentration of DPE on the formation of CuCore NPs were tested at 0, 60, and 120 米m, respectively, while keeping all other conditions the same."

Then, 30 mL NH3?H2O (0.15 m) solution was added to the Cu(NO3)2 solution under constant stirring at room temperature. A blue precipitate of Cu(OH)2 was produced when dropwise added 10 mL of NaOH (1 m) solution (＞2 mL min?1) to the above solution to adjust the pH value to 9每10. After 30 min, the blue Cu(OH)2 precipitate was filtered washed several times to obtain a solid product, and then dried in the vacuum oven for overnight. Secondly, the nanoporous CuO was prepared by annealing the Cu(OH)2 nanorods in the static air atmosphere at 500 ～C for 2 h with a heating rate of 32 ～C min?1. At last, the nanoporous copper was obtained by the electrochemical reduction of nanoporous CuO on GDL at a constant current density of 10 mA cm?2 in the same cell as CO2 reduction, and the corresponding applied voltages of different electrolyte were listed in the Table S7 in the Supporting Information."

After rising with deionized water, the prepared NF was thorough dried. For Cu electrodeposition on NF, constant current (?1.5 A) was applied with prepared NF as cathode immersed into a solution of 0.5 m CuSO4 and 1.0 m H2SO4 for 2000 s. The fresh sample was washed several times with deionized water and thorough dried by blowing Ar gas. The prepared sample was heated at 500 ～C for 12 h in air atmosphere and cooled down to room temperature (25每30 ～C) over several hours. The annealed dark gray sample was then electrochemically reduced to dark red oxide-derived Cu catalyst in 0.5 m KHCO3 solution at constant potential of ?1.8 V versus SCE for several minutes until the reduction current curve became stable."

Motivated by the electronic interaction concept that occurs when transition metals hybridized with another transition metal compounds,[10] the Cu2O/CuO@M nanowires (M = Ni, Fe, Co) structures were achieved via a rapid galvanic replacement method in 5 min. Nanoparticles of Ni (Figure 1c), Fe (Figure S3, Supporting Information), and Co (Figure S4, Supporting Information) were uniformly distributed on Cu2O/ CuO nanowires. Compared with the smooth nanowire surface ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim1901396 (3 of 9) of Cu2O/CuO (Figure 1b), the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis in Figure 1d shows that the nanowires of Cu2O/CuO@Ni hybrid are characterized with nanoparticles. The presence of Cu2O phase in pristine Cu2O/CuO, Cu2O/ CuO@Co, Cu2O/Cu @Fe, and Cu2O/CuO@Ni nanowires was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The (110), (111), (200), (220), and (311) phases of Cu2O (JCPDS no. 34-1354) were identified by the XRD spectra for all the samples in Figure S5a in the Supporting Information. The enlarged XRD spectra in Figure S5b in the Supporting Information show the (200) and (?112) phases of CuO (JCPDS no. 45-0937), suggesting the heterostructure between Cu2O and CuO. In addition, the (110) phase of Cu2O shows an increase after metal coating, indicating that the loading of nanoparticles could improve the content of Cu2O."

Next, the black slurry was uniformly coated onto a Cu foil and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 80 ～C. A coin-type cell with the Li foil as the counter electrode and 1 m LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of ethyl carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) as the electrolyte (1/1 = v/v) were used for the electrochemical lithiation. The cells containing the Li foil and working electrodes were assembled with a separator (Celgard) and an electrolyte in an Ar-filled glove box (O2 < 0.1 ppm and H2O < 0.1 ppm). The lithiation process was monitored using a VSP potentiostat (Bio-logic) to maintain the static current of 10 mA g?1. After the lithiation process was carried out, the resulting samples produced at each process step were washed with acetone, water, and 1 ℅ 10?3 m acetic acid solution to remove residual electrolytes, Li2O, and solid electrolyte interlayers."

[22, 23] The increased length of Cu(OH)2 NWs was obtained by immersing Cu foils in the solution mixture for longer time. After a discrete synthesis time, the Cu foils were taken out from the solution, rinsed with de-ionized water and absolute ethanol, and dried with nitrogen. CuO NWs were then fabricated by annealing the Cu(OH)2 NW arrays at 150 8C for 2 hours in air. [21] The resulting CuO NW arrays were directly used in the electroreduction of CO2, and were electrochemically reduced to Cu NW arrays during electrolysis.[21] Thus, the annealed Cu(OH)2 NWs with gradually increased length and density were electrochemically reduced to Cu NWs with corresponding increased length and density.

Then the resulting solution was heated up to 210 8C quickly and refluxed at this temperature for 1 h before cooling down to room temperature naturally.

Then the resulting solution was heated up to 220 8C quickly and refluxed at this temperature for 1 h. In order to obtain Cu nanocubes with a larger edge length (63 nm), the content of TOPO was reduced to 2.5 mmol, while the temperature and the aging time was increased to 2608C and 2.5 h, respectively. Cu NCs spheres were obtained by following similar procedure. For the synthesis of Cu spheres of 27 nm, oleylamine (35 mL) and CuBr (3 mmol) were mixed in a three-necked flask by strong magnetic stirring at 80 8C for 15 min, then TOP (6 mmol) was injected into the obtained green solution, which immediately became colorless.

In addition, weak peaks of cubic Cu2O (111), (200), and (220) planes with a space group of Pn3?m (COD: 1000063) are observed due to oxidation in air or Cu-B interaction with the solvent during synthesis. Similarly, peaks assigned to hexagonal Zn (P63/mmc, COD: 9012435) and ZnO (P63mc, COD: 9008877) are both observed in the XRD pattern of the assynthesized Zn sample (Figure 1 B), with the intensity of the oxide peaks being notably higher compared to B-Cu due to faster oxidation of metallic Zn."

The sapphire powder of as-prepared CuOHFCl NSs can be synthesized at gram-scale in a single hydrothermal synthesis using an autoclave of 100 milliliters (Figure 1a). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and Rietveld refinement result of the CuOHFCl NSs were shown in Figure 1b (Rwp = 9.63%, Rp = 11.4%). The asprepared CuOHFCl NSs possesses kagome layered structure with CuI atoms in the kagome lattice and CuII atoms between kagome layers (Figure 1c).[20] Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the sheet-like morphology of the as-prepared CuOHFCl NSs with a few microns in planar scale and about tens of nanometers in thickness (Figure 1 d and Figure S2). Both the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) (Figure 1e) and the selective area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 1 f) pointed out a highly ordered hexagonal crystalline structure. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping analysis shows the uniform distribution of elemental Cu, Cl, F, and O (Figure 1g每j). The XPS analysis also confirmed the existence of Cl (7.23 at%) and F (6.61 at%) in the as-prepared CuOHFCl nanosheet (Figure 1k每n and Table S1)."

Then the substrate was immersed in a 6 M HCl solution at 70 C for 30 min to eliminate the native oxide. The electrolyte for Cu electrodeposition consisted of 0.12 M CuSO4 5H2O (99.0%, Daejung, Siheung-si, Korea), 0.5 M H2SO4 (95.0%, Junsei, Toyko, Japan), 1.2 M (NH4)2SO4 (99.0%, Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, Massachusetts, USA), and 0.4 mM BTA (98.5%, Daejung).34 Electrodeposition was performed in a conventional three-electrode system composed of the Ti foil as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, KCl saturated) as the reference electrode. The Ti foil was sealed in a lab-made Teflon cell with an area of 1.13 cm2 exposed to the electrolyte. The Cu foam on the Ti foil substrate was fabricated using two chronopotentiometry steps, at ?2.5 mA/cm2 for 60 s and at ?1200 mA/cm2 for 40 s, which were controlled using a potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm, Herisau, Swiss). After careful washing with deionized water, the Cu foam was immersed in an Ag displacement solution consisting of 0.05 M AgNO3 (99.9%, Alfa Aesar), 0.5 M (NH4)2SO4 (99.0%, Alfa Aesar), and 3.5 M NH4OH (28.0%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) for 10 min at room temperature.35 Ag displacement was conducted without and with the additives BTA (98.5%, Daejung), PVP (average mol. wt. 40 000, Sigma-Aldrich), and NA (95%, SigmaAldrich). All the electrolytes used to fabricate the Ag/Cu foams were purged by N2 gas (99.995%) flow for 30 min before the experiments. To image the morphologies of the Ag/Cu foams, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, SIGMA, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used. The crystal structure was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD, New D8 Advance, Bruker-AXS, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA). The surface properties of the Ag/Cu foams were investigated using anodic scans in linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in a 0.1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 1 mV/s. Electrochemical CO2 conversion by the Ag/Cu foams was performed using an H-type cell (Pine Research Instrumentation, Durham, North Carolina, USA). The cell capacity was 25 mL for both the cathode and anode parts, which were separated by a proton-conducting membrane (Nafion, Wilmington, Delaware, USA NRE-212). The cathode part contained an Ag/Cu foam as a working electrode and an SCE as a reference electrode. The exposed area of the working electrode was fixed at 0.5 cm2. The anode part contained Pt gauze as a counter electrode. KHCO3 (99.5%, Daejung, 0.1 M) at a pH of 6.8 was used for both the catholyte and anolyte, which were purged by N2 gas for 30 min. Then, the catholyte was purged by CO2 gas (99.995%) at a rate of 300 sccm for at least 45 min before the activity measurement. To maintain CO2 saturation during the experiment, CO2 gas was continuously injected into the catholyte at a rate of 10 sccm, ensuring that the product gases entered the sampling loop for gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890A). The chronoamperometry method was adopted to analyze the catalytic activity of the Ag/Cu foams at various potentials for 30 min. The CO concentration generated at the cathode was measured by a flame ionization detector (FID) in the GC instrument. Then, the CO Faradaic efficiency was obtained by calculating the concentration of generated CO and the amount of electrochemically applied charge."

The deposition was performed at a fixed current of 0.8 mA until a total charge of 0.5 Ccm 2, 1 Ccm 2, 3 Ccm 2, or 5 Ccm 2 was passed. The catalyst loading obtained in this preparation carried out in a galvanostatic mode, was determined by the duration of the experiment, hence the total charge passed through the electrode.[3g] After the deposition, the electrode was thoroughly rinsed with MilliQ water (18.2 Mohmcm) and left to dry in open air."

A certain gram of the precursor and the template were mixed and dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water under stirring to form a uniform solution. The mixtures were treated with ultrasound for 15 min, followed by the addition of 2 ml of NH3 ﹞H2O into the solution. A certain amount of NaOH solution (1 M) was added to the solution under stirring to obtain light blue precipitates. The precipitates were then filtered and washed several times using deionized water and ethanol. The precipitates were subsequently dried at 60 ～C and calcined at 200每 500 ～C in a muffle furnace to obtain the desired CuO catalysts. The samples calcined at varied temperatures were labeled as CuO X, where X denoted the calcination temperature. Schematic illustration of the manufacturing process of the nanostructured CuO by the template-assisted homogeneous precipitation can be found in Scheme 1 and Figure S7. CuO particles were deposited on carbon paper substrate with a geometric size of 1 cm℅1 cm to form electrode for electrochemical tests. The loading of CuO on the substrate is 100 mg/cm2."

In a typical process, the total molar amount of metal ions is 5 mmol. CuCl2 and SnCl2 with a certain molar ratio (seeing Table S1 for details) were added into 50 mL of deionized water to obtain a homogeneous emulsion solution under continuous stirring for 1 h. Then concentrated ammonia hydroxide was added dropwise to the above solution until neutral. After vigorously stirring for another 2 h, the resultant precipitate was centrifugated, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 80 ～C. Afterwards, the precipitate was annealed at 400 ～C for 2 h in a muffle furnace. Finally, a series of SnO2/CuO NCs were obtained after naturally cooling to room temperature. As comparisons, the pure SnO2 and CuO were also synthesized by the similar method. In addition, the SnO2 CuO physical mixture was obtained by grinding the pure SnO2 and CuO in an agate mortar for 30 minutes."

Basically, metal precursors (CuCl2, Alfa Aesar and K2PdCl4, Alfa Aesar) with different atomic ratios were dissolved in 100 mL diethylene glycol (DEG, Alfa Aesar) that acts both as a solvent and a reducing agent under 30 min stirring at 25 ～C. The pH value was adjusted at 11 with 2.0 molL 1 NaOH in DEG prior to add the desired amount of carbon substrate (Vulcan XC72R), which is previously treated under N2 atmosphere at 400 ～C for 4 h. The mixture was then maintained under vigorous stirring (1000 rpm) for 15 min in order to have a homogeneous suspension. Afterwards the mixture was rapidly heated in the microwave oven (CEM, Synthesis Technology Inside) with the power output of 1600 W irradiation at 185 ～C under N2 gas flowing (1.0 bar) for 30 min. Finally, the mixture was filtered on a 0.22 米m GSWP (FisherBioblock paper) and washed several times with ultra-pure water (18.2 M次 cm, 20 ～C).

Firstly, copper nanowires (Cu NWs) array was in-situ formed on the Cu foam (CF). After that, the surrounding Cu NWs was transformed into Cu3Sn alloy via a hydrothermal method in virtue of the neighbouring Sn source. Noted that the amorphous SnO2 shell was concomitantly developed on the Cu3Sn alloy surface because the Sn atom was prone to aggregating and oxidizing on the outer layer for low surface energy.[22] For the inner Cu3Sn core, the subsequent diffusion of Sn atoms from the inner to the outer layer as well as the residual Cu atoms both contributes to the formation of amorphous Cu doped SnO2 shell. Therefore, a unique coreshell-type Cu3Sn@Cu-SnO2 NWs hierarchical structure was obtained."

The characteristics of the prepared Bi/Cu catalyst electrodes were shown in figure 1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (figure 1a) images showed that the Cu foam was coated by nano-coral-like structures. This morphological feature can be confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (figure 1b). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) showed the lattice d-spacing with an average size of 0.329 nm, corresponding to the (012) face lattice distance of metallic Bi, indicating the coral-like microstructure is composed of Bi.[20] Moreover, the elemental distribution results by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) elemental analysis were presented in figure 1c每e. Interestingly, the images revealed that both Bi and Cu were distributed uniformly on the coral-like structure, indicating that the co-deposition of Bi and Cu has taken place during the deposition process.[21] It is possibly related to the galvanic displacement reaction, the Cu [a] M.

Typical phenolic resol preparation procedure is the following: 6.50 mmol phenol (Sigma Aldrich 99 %) was melted at 42 8C and then 0.65 mmol NaOH 20 wt.% (Sigma Aldrich ACS Reagent 97 %, pellets) was added slowly over 10 min under stirring. 13 mmol formaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich, 37 wt.% in H2O, contains 10每15 % methanol as stabilizer) was added drop-wise, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 72 8C for 30 min. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, the pH value of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 8.0 using a 0.6 mol L 1 HCl (37 % AnalaR NORMAPUR ) aqueous solution. Water was then evaporated under vacuum below 50 8C and the final product was re-dissolved in 10 mL absolute ethanol. In parallel, 2.1 mmol Cu(NO3)2.3H2O was dissolved in 15 mL absolute ethanol, containing 1.0 g of Pluronic F-127. To obtain complete dissolution, the mixture was stirred at 1000 rpm for 30 min at 21 8C. Then, the phenolic resol solution was slowly dropped into the Pluronic-Copper nitrate solution under stirring (600 rpm) which was maintained for 30 min. Then, the mixture was disposed in four Petri dishes and dried under fume hood at 21 8C overnight. Thermo-polymerization was conducted at 100 8C for 24 h and carbonization was performed at 350 or 500 8C for 3 h with a heating rate of 5 8C min 1 under Argon atmosphere with a flow rate of 7 L min 1. The final products were denoted as Cu/FDU-15-T, where T represents the carbonization temperature as Cu/FDU-15-350 and Cu/FDU-15-500. In addition, FDU-15-T samples were prepared by using the same procedure but without adding the Cu salt precursor."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Synthesis of the MOPMs: HKUST-1 was prepared by a previously described solvent-free synthetic route.[58] In a first step, stoichiometric amounts of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid and copper(II) acetate monohydrate were ground together to ensure a homogeneous mixture and placed in the reaction vessel. The reagent mixture was oven-heated for approximately 50 h at a heating rate of 2 8C h 1 to a maximum temperature of 120 8C. Polycrystalline CuAdeAce material was prepared by the slow addition of acetic acid to an aqueous solution containing adenine and CuII salt in equimolar proportions.[59] Both MOFs were washed thoroughly with water to remove unreacted reagents and remaining byproducts. The general procedure to prepare the MOAs (CuDTA and CuZnDTA) proceeded as follows. The corresponding metal acetate (or metal salt mixture) was dissolved in a mixture of N,N＊-dimethylacetamide (DMA) and DMF in a 60:40 volumetric ratio, aided by an ultrasonic tip (Vibra-Cell VCX130 20 kHz and 130 W, Sonics) at 80 % of its power for 2 min. Then, dithiooxamide (H2DTA) ligand, basified with triethylamine, was dissolved in the same solvent mixture and added into the metal-ion-containing solution with the system maintained in an ultrasound bath (ULTRASONS-H, Selecta) at a temperature of 288 K. Once the metal每organic gel reached a certain consistency, it was allowed to age at room temperature for 1 d. Thereafter, the materials were washed first through immersion in pure DMF to remove the unreacted species and then by successive solvent exchanges in DMF/ethanol mixtures and pure ethanol to replace the solvent. In each exchange step, the contact between the solvent and gel was 24 h to ensure an efficient exchange. To prepare the aerogels, an E3100 critical-point dryer from Quorum Technologies equipped with gas-inlet, vent, and purge valves and a thermal bath was employed. Firstly, the gel was immersed in liquid CO2 at 293 K and 50 bar for 1 h. After this, the exchanged ethanol was removed through the purge valve. This process was repeated five times. Subsequently, the sample was dried under supercritical conditions at a temperature of 311 K and a pressure of 85每95 bar. Finally, under constant temperature (311 K), the chamber was vented slowly to atmospheric pressure. Details on the characterization of the prepared MOPMs are provided in the Supporting Information (S2)."

Samples containing a single metallic element Cu or Zn were synthesized for the purpose of comparison. The six catalysts, namely Cu, CuZnx (where x is the atomic ratio of Zn/(Cu+Zn) in the precursor solution, Cu-Zn) and ZnO, were prepared with various concentrations of different precursors (Table S1). In a typical synthesis, the Cu and Zn salts were dissolved in 35 mL of EG and 5 mL of H2O to form solution 1, and 914 mg of NaOH was dissolved in 17 mL of EG and 3 mL of H2O to form solution 2. Then, solution 2 was added into solution 1 drop by drop. After 10 min of vigorous agitation, the mixture was then transferred into a Teflon vessel (volume 100 mL). The Teflon vessel was put in a microwave oven (Milestone STARTSynth, Milestone Inc., Shelton, Connecticut) and connected to pressure and temperature probes. The mixture was irradiated for 11 min at 900 W (TMax. = 220 ～C), and then was cooled to ambient temperature. The precipitate was separated by centrifuge and washed twice with H2O and once with ethanol. The powder sample was finally obtained by vacuum drying at 60 ～C overnight."

The thickness of the Ni foam is 1 mm and it was purchased from QiJing Trading Co., Ltd Store, China. Electrodeposition of Cu on Ni foam was carried out by using our previously reported method [36]. 0.05 M of CuSO4.5H2O and 0.1 M of H2SO4 were dissolved in 100 ml distilled water. The as-prepared solution was used as the electrolyte for the electrodeposition of copper on conductive Ni foam with an exposed area of 1 ℅ 1 cm. A platinum wire and an Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) electrodes were used as a counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The potentiostatic electrodeposition of Cu on Ni foam was performed at a constant potential of ?0.9 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for 60 s.

First, 50 mL of 0.1 m Cu(CH3COO)2﹞H2O was prepared using Millipore water. Next, 1.0 g P-123 and extra 50 mL water were added to the above Cu(CH3COO)2﹞H2O solution, which was stirred till all P-123 dissolved into the solution. After that, 8 mL of 0.1 m ascorbic acid aqueous solution was quickly injected to the mixed solution, and extra 42 mL water was added with stirring for 1 min. The 150 mL final solution was incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Then, the orange precipitates obtained were subsequently washed four times with 40 mL of water each time and once with 40 mL of acetone to completely remove the unreacted precursors. Finally, the products were obtained by centrifugation and blow-dried using pure N2."

First, PcCu每Fe每ZIF-8 was fabricated by mixing PcCu, iron nitrate, zinc nitrate, and 2-Me-imidazole. The mixture was stirred overnight to obtain a blue precipitate, as a result of the bonding of PcCu molecules to Fe, which is coordinated to the organic ligand as nodes, so it is ensured that the Cu and Fe species are dispersed in the framework homogeneously. Subsequently, the blue precipitates were annealed at 1000? ～C under an argon atmosphere, and PcCu每Fe每ZIF-8 is carbonized and transformed into binary atomic Cu每Fe sites, dispersed on the nitrogen-doped carbon matrix without any further acid leaching treatment (denoted as Cu每Fe每N6每C; the details can be found in the Supporting Information)."

First, the solution was heated to 80?～C at a rate of 5 ～C min?1 and maintained at 80?～C for 1 h. Then, the solution was gradually heated to 170 ～C and 210 ～C at a rate of 10 ～C min?1, and each temperature section was maintained for 1 h to obtain Cu NPs. The obtained purple solution was cooled naturally to room temperature. For the preparation of Cu@Ag-2 NPs, the mixture of AgNO3 (0.2?mmol, 33.9?mg) and 10?mL of OAm was poured dropwise into the above purple solution of Cu NPs at the rate of 30?mL h?1. After vigorous stirring, the mixture solution was heated to 60?～C at 5 ～C min?1 for 3 h under Ar atmosphere. The products were washed with hexane and acetone, and centrifuged at 3000?rpm for 10?min. The Cu@Ag-2 NPs were dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight for further characterization. The entire experiment process was kept under strict anaerobic conditions to prevent the possibility of NPs being oxidized."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Cu2O/CuO /CuS catalyst was prepared on the commercially available copper mesh using scalable and simple two- step synthesis processes as shown in Scheme?1. During the first thermal oxidation, Cu2O/CuO layers were formed on the surface of the copper mesh and then copper sulfide nanoparticles were loaded on it by SILAR of Cu2O/CuO electrode in 0.01?M methanol solutions of copper nitrate and sodium sulfide. The thermal oxidation of copper mesh and the experimental set-up of the manually operated SILAR deposition system are illustrated in Scheme?1. That is, clean copper mesh (Scheme?1a) was firstly oxidized in air (at 450?～C for 4?h) to fabricate the electrode (Scheme?1b). Then Cu2O/ CuO was dipped in the cationic precursor solution (Cu(NO3)2) for 1?min, resulting in Cu2+ being adsorbed onto the surface of the Cu2O/CuO film (Scheme?1c). Consequently, this electrode was immersed in methanol solution for 10?s to remove excess adsorbed ions from the precursor (Scheme?1d). Thirdly, the sample was then immersed in the anionic precursor (Na2S) solution for 1?min, resulting in the reaction of sulfide ions (S2?) with the adsorbed Cu2+ on the surface of the Cu2O/CuO electrode (Scheme?1e). Lastly, the excess and/or unreacted species and the reaction byproduct from the diffusion layer were removed by rinsing the electrode in pure methanol solution (Scheme?1f). Through this, one cycle of CuS deposition on the surface of Cu2O/ CuO layer was completed. The amount deposited CuS can be increased and controlled by repeating the immersion cycles."

In addition, three different Cu2O nanocubes were synthesized using NaCl, NaBr and NaI solutions. Briefly, 2.5?mL of 0.01?M Cu(NO3)2 3H2O, and 1.2?g of fructose were added into a 200?mL of double neck round bottom flask, followed by the addition of 2.5?mL of 1?M NaOH and 5?mL of 0.0788?M L-ascorbic acid. The resultant solution was diluted to 100?mL with ultrapure water. Thus prepared solution (pH 12.2) was mildly stirred for 1?h at room temperature. The resulting solution was centrifuged at a relative centrifugal force (RCF) of 20,000℅g for 20?min and re-suspended in ultrapure water. The same centrifugation procedure was repeated about three times to remove the unreacted species. The Cu2O nanoparticle solutions were stored at ??4?～C to avoid over-oxidation of the surface. However, partial oxidation of surface is inevitable due to the atmospheric oxygen. A similar procedure was followed by the addition of 1?mL of 10?mM NaCl, NaBr, or NaI aqueous solutions after the L-ascorbic acid. Thus synthesized copper oxide nanocubes are referred to as Cu2O/CuO, Cu2O/CuO_Cl, Cu2O/CuO_Br, and Cu2O/CuO_I respectively. Each 1?mL of Cu2O/CuO and Cu2O/CuO_X solutions were dried at 60?～C to determine the weight of Cu2O/CuO. The weight of nanocubes in 1?mL of Cu2O/CuO, Cu2O/CuO_Cl, Cu2O/CuO_Br, and Cu2O/ CuO_I was found to be 45 ㊣ 3, 42, ㊣ 4, 30 ㊣ 6 and 35 ㊣ 5?米g, respectively. 10?mL of 5 wt.% PVA aqueous solution was added to 10?mL (50?mg) of GO aqueous solution. Thus resulted PVA-GO mixture was sonicated for 30?min to achieve a homogeneous dispersion. 0.5?mL of hydrazine was added to the PVA-GO solution and heated at 95?～C for 3?h to form the PVA/rGO composite. The resulting solution was cooled and stored at ambient conditions for further use."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Successful preparation of Cu2O nanocubes was achieved only in alkaline (pH 12.2) conditions by using Cu(NO3)2 3H2O, fructose and ascorbic acid. The Cu2+ ions were stabilized by fructose via Cu(OH)-fructose complexation followed by the reduction to Cu2O. However, considering the partial surface oxidation of Cu2O, the nanocubes were designated as Cu2O/CuO. The growth rate, size, and morphology of Cu2O can be tuned by the presence of halides in the solution, where different halides possess different adsorption strengths on the crystal facets of Cu2O [29]. The addition of 1?mL of 10?mM sodium halides (NaCl, NaBr, or NaI) during the synthesis of nanocubes alters the ionic strength of the solution, which affects the growth of Cu adatoms and hence the size of nanocubes [30, 31]. Scheme?1a illustrates the step-wise processes involved in the synthesis of Cu2O/CuO nanocubes. Figure?1a每d displays HR-TEM images of Cu2O/CuO, Cu2O/CuO_Cl, Cu2O/CuO_Br, and Cu2O/CuO_I nanocubes, respectively. The average size of Cu2O/CuO nanocubes was calculated to be 37 ㊣ 3?nm, while the presence of Cl? ions led to the formation of 10?nm smaller Cu2O/CuO_Cl nanocubes. While conducting the same synthesis procedure in presence of Br? or I?, larger particles were formed with average diameters of 62 ㊣ 4 and 207 ㊣ 3?nm, respectively. Figure S1(A) shows the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of Cu, Cl?, Br? and I? elements. Figure S1(B) displays the EDS spectrum of the Cu2O/CuO_Cl, Cu2O/CuO_Br, and Cu2O/CuO_I nanocubes. The EDS mapping unambiguously displays the spatial distribution of Cl? ions with at.% of 0.39 on the surface of nanocubes, confirming the specificity of Cl? ion adsorption over the surface of Cu2O. Hence, the growth of Cu2O cubes was ceased by the preferable adsorption of Cl? ions over the surface of Cu2O, which resulted in smaller nanocubes. The adsorbed Cl? ions thermodynamically stabilizes the surface structures and increases the surface area of Cu2O/ CuO_Cl [29, 32]. Random and lower intensities of purple dots were observed in Figure S1(A)b∪ and c∪, which indicates the presence Br? and I? ions without any specific adsorption on the surface of nanocubes. In addition, the at.% of Cl (0.39%) is higher than the Br? (0.20%) and I? (0.31%) elements. Ignaczak et?al. has shown that the decrease in adsorption energy while going from F? to I? on the Cu, Ag and Au metals via density functional theory calculations [33]. XPS is a sensitive technique to gain insight into the surface composition and electronic state of the species. The surface of Cu2O could undergo oxidation in ambient conditions and leave the surface of nanocubes with mixed oxidation states of Cu (such as Cu+ and Cu2+) [34]. Quantification of the relative amount of Cu(II) species on the Cu2O surface could give an insight into the catalytic activity of Cu2O nanocubes [35]. The ratios of Cu (I): Cu(II) was calculated from the Cu2p3/2 spectra using the methodology developed by Gerson and Jaseniak [36]. Figure?2 shows the Cu 2p core level profile XPS spectra of as-synthesized (a) Cu2O/CuO, (b) Cu2O/CuO_Cl, (c) Cu2O/CuO_Br and (d) Cu2O/CuO_I nanocubes. The deconvoluted XPS spectra of (a), (b), (c) and (d) displays the Cu2p3/2 level at 934.3, 934.2, 933.1 and 933.0?eV; Cu2p1/2 level at 954.3, 954.3, 954.0 and 952.8?eV respectively, which can be assigned to Cu+ present in Cu2O. Particularly, Cu2O/CuO_Cl, Cu2O/CuO_Br, and Cu2O/CuO_I nanocubes show peaks at 936.9, 935.0 and 934.9?eV respectively, these peaks can be assigned to Cu2+, which indicates the formation of CuO surface layer. The main peak present (935.0 and 934.9?eV) in Cu2O/ CuO_Br and Cu2O/CuO_I nanocubes indicates the significant oxide layer over the Cu2O surface. Hence, the availability of Cu2O active sites to the CO2RR has diminished significantly. Cu2O/CuO_Cl nanocubes consist of mainly Cu2O species (80%) with a minor surface CuO phase (20%). Peaks at 944.1, 944.5, 941.0, 942.0; 949.9?eV were"

PVA/rGO/ (Cu2O/CuO) solution was sonicated for 1?h to form an ink-like dispersion. The resulting ink (1?mL) was dropped on to (5?℅?2) cm2 area of a microscopic glass slide and dried overnight at room temperature to form PVA/rGO/ (Cu2O/CuO) film. Similarly, PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Cl), PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Br), and PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_I), thin films were prepared using ~ 1.31?米g of Cu2O/CuO_Cl, Cu2O/CuO_Br, and Cu2O/CuO_I solutions, respectively. In Fig.?3b, XRD patterns of all the films displayed a broad peak at 2牟 value of 19.5～ which corresponds to PVA [39]. The characteristic peaks of Cu2O/CuO or Cu2O/CuO_X did not appear because of their ultra-low (0.87每3.06?米g/ cm2) loadings and their existence within the PVA/rGO sheets. The mechanical properties of PVA fibers facilitate the formation of a stable and flexible film. The free-standing PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Cl) thin film is stable after twisting, and tape tests, showing its mechanical strength which is one of the desired properties of free-standing working electrodes (Figure S2). In the case of free-standing electrodes, no direct support of the current collector is used; hence the intrinsic electrical conductivity of thin films itself needs to be high enough to conduct the electrons. Electrical conductivity of PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO), PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Cl), PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Br), and PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_I), films were measured to be 0.160, 0.182, 0.185 and 0.380 S/m via two probe-method, respectively. These conductivity values are four orders of magnitude lower than that of the reported rGO (2420 S/m) and 30 times lower than the rGO/PVA [39, 40]. The presence of non-conducting PVA on to the rGO sheets could decrease the conductivity of the free-standing thin films."

Cu2O/CuO nanocubes were synthesized in the presence of sodium halides (1?mL of 10?mM NaCl, NaBr and NaI) at room temperature. Cl? ion adsorption over the surface of Cu2O hindered the adsorption of adatoms to Cu2O crystal facets and formed 27 ㊣ 2?nm size particles, whereas Br? and I? ions did not show notable adsorption on Cu2O surface and yielded the particles with larger sizes, 62 ㊣ 4 and 207 ㊣ 3?nm, respectively. The high-resolution photoelectron spectrum revealed a small CuO surface phase present over the Cu2O nanocubes. The ratio of Cu2O: CuO for (a) Cu2O/CuO, (b) Cu2O/CuO_Cl, (c) Cu2O/CuO_Br and (d) Cu2O/CuO_I was calculated to be 87:13, 80:20, 34:66 and 35:65. PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Cl) film exhibited superior CO2 reduction activity in terms of onset potential (??0.40?V vs. RHE) and current density (0.12?mA?cm?2 at ??0.80?V vs. RHE) than that of the PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/ CuO), PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Br), and PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/ CuO_I) thin films. GC每MS analysis revealed the formation of methanol as a single liquid product. Methanol yield of 19.5?米mol cm?2?h?1 at ??0.85?V vs. RHE is observed on the PVA/rGO/(Cu2O/CuO_Cl) thin film. The FE for methanol and H2 gas were found to be 63 and 20% at ??0.75?V vs RHE, respectively, which is the highest FE among the 每?0.75, ??0.80 and ??0.85?V vs. RHE. With the advantages of low-cost, flexibility, high mechanical strength, catalytic activity, and stability, the free-standing thin films prepared through direct evaporation assisted self-assembly method holds great potential for the use in electrocatalysis and chemical industries to generate pure methanol."

In a typical synthesis (Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information), 900 mg of Cu salt and a certain amount of Sn salt were dissolved in 20 mL of EG to form solution 1, and 1280 mg of NaOH was dissolved in 24 mL of EG and 4 mL of H2O to form solution 2. Then, solution 2 was added into solution 1 drop by drop. After 10 min of vigorous agitation, the mixture was then transferred into a Teflon vessel (volume 100 mL). The Teflon vessel was put in a microwave oven (Milestone STARTSynth, Milestone Inc., Shelton, Connecticut) and connected to pressure and temperature probes. The mixture was irradiated for 10 min at 180 C (Max. 900 W) and then was cooled to ambient temperature. The precipitate was separated by centrifuge and washed twice with H2O and once with ethanol. The powder sample was finally obtained by vacuum drying at 60 C overnight. Three catalysts, namely Cu(II)Sn(II)5, Cu(II)Sn(IV)5 and Cu(II)Sn(IV)10, were prepared in a solution with both Cu and Sn salts as well as a Cu(II) catalyst with only Cu precursor."

Copper foils (99.5%, Aladdin, China) were put into boiling saturated copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4) solution to form Cu2O. First, the copper foils (10? cm ℅ 5? cm) were pretreated by successive immersion in 10?V% hydrochloric acid (HCl) (36.5每38.0%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and anhydrous ethanol (AR, Aladdin) for 5每10?min to remove impurities and organic matter on the surface of the foils, and then cleaned with distilled water. After that, the pretreated copper foils were put into a saturated solution of CuSO4 at 80? ～C for 1?h, 2?h, and 4?h. Then, the copper foils were placed in hot water at 80?～C for 2?h, and the water was changed several times to remove the CuSO4 on the surface of the copper foils. Finally, the copper foils were placed in a vacuum drying oven at 150? ～C for 2?h, then a batch of copper foils attached with Cu2O film was obtained. The prepared samples were named Cu-1h, Cu-2h, and Cu-4h. The electrode area of all electrodes was 8? cm2. Because the acidity of the saturated CuSO4 solution increased more slowly with the extension of immersion time (as shown in Fig. S1), compared with the Cu2O film prepared by Fernando et?al. [32] using a dilute solution of CuSO4, the Cu2O layer prepared in this work was thicker, the Cu2O particles were more compact and uniform, so they had better surface performance."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Cu2O film electrodes were prepared using an improved solution immersion method, and ZnO nanoparticles were attached to Cu2O film electrodes using an electrodeposition method. All the electrodes were characterized and used for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. The pure Cu2O film electrode obtained by immersing and reacting in saturated CuSO4 solution for 2?h had a more uniform particle distribution, and its CH3OH yield was the highest in the pure Cu2O film electrodes, indicating that Cu(I) species may have a good selectivity to CH3OH in CO2 reduction, and significantly improved the electrode activity. In contrast, the Cu(II) sites were more prone to hydrogen evolution, which inhibited the reduction of CO2. The ZnO/Cu2O film electrode prepared under the condition of a Zn2+ concentration of 0.05?M and with the deposition time of 30?min had a very high CH3OH formation rate of 52.609?米mol/ (cm2 h), and the Faradaic efficiency reached 45%, both of which were significantly higher than other electrodes. The experimental results indicated that the appropriate Zn2+ concentration and deposition time produced ZnO with uniform shape, distribution, and large specific surface area, thereby enhancing the CO2 adsorption capacity of electrodes. Moreover, the addition of ZnO helped the intermediate products of CO2 reduction to be better fixed on Cu2O. The fundamental reaction mechanisms of CO2 reduction to form CH3OH on the surface of pure Cu2O and ZnO/Cu2O films were also elucidated, which included the transfer of CO2, reduction of CO2 to intermediate product, and proton transfer to H3CO to form CH3OH. The results of this paper provided a relatively reasonable explanation for the electrocatalytic reduction performance of pure Cu2O and ZnO/Cu2O films, and provided some new schemes for the preparation of electrodes for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2."

The typical procedure is as follows: 40 mg PVP, 25 mg CTAB, and 50 mL EG were placed into a three-necked flask under constant magnetic stirring (300 r?min每1) and heated in an oil bath. When the temperature reached 140～C, 9 mL of 0.11 mol?L每1 Cu(CH3COO)2 solution was injected. The mixture was heated to 170～C and maintained for 10 min under continuous stirring. The color of the mixture solution changed from deep blue to dark green, indicating the formation of Cu2O. After the solution cooled to room temperature, Cu2O was separated by centrifugation with acetone, pure water, and ethanol at 8000 r?min每1 for 10 min in sequence. The obtained precipitates were dried at 60～C for 24 h in a vacuum oven. For the synthesis of Ag/Cu2O, the Cu2O spheres were not separated from the solution. In one pot, the required amount of AgNO3 solution was added to the Cu2Ocontaining mother solution at 170～C. The mixture was stirred for another 10 min, during which the color of the solution changed from dark green to deep gray. Finally, the suspension was centrifuged and the obtained solid was dried under the same conditions as mentioned above. The Ag content of the Ag/Cu2O composites was tuned by varying the concentration of the AgNO3 solution. The samples are denoted as Agx/Cu2O, where x represents the atomic ratio of Ag to Cu added to the reaction mixture. The obtained products are accordingly denoted as Ag0.125/ Cu2O, Ag0.25/Cu2O, Ag0.5/Cu2O, and Ag1/Cu2O. Galvanic replacement was also employed to synthesize Au/Cu2O using the as-prepared Cu2O nanospheres as a template. In the typical procedure: 7.2 mg of Cu2O nanospheres was added to 26 mL deionized water at room temperature. Thereafter, 3 mL PVP aqueous solution (1.0 wt-%) was added to the above solution under stirring, followed by 0.5 mL of 0.06 mol?L每1 aqueous chloroauric acid solution. After 3 h of reaction, the suspension was centrifuged. The obtained solid was washed with pure water and ethanol, and dried at 60～C for 24 h in a vacuum oven."

First, Cu2O nanospheres, with a uniform particle size of ~180 nm, were prepared. Thereafter, Ag/Cu2O composites were fabricated by using Cu2O as a sacrificial template. By varying the Ag/ Cu atomic ratio, a Ag0.125/Cu2O composite possessing a hierarchical flower-like nanostructure with intersecting Ag nanoflakes encompassing an inner Cu2O sphere were prepared. The catalytic performance in the ERC was evaluated in terms of the FE of each product and current density. In comparison with the Cu2O nanospheres, the Ag/ Cu2O samples all present a higher FECO and somewhat suppressed H2 evolution due to the combination of the catalytic ability of Ag combined with Cu2O. Notably, Ag0.125/Cu2O exhibited the highest CO evolution rate as a result of the hierarchical structure, which provides a larger electroactive surface area. The obtained Au0.6/Cu2O composite with the same flower-like structure presented superior catalytic performance with a 10% higher FECO. Importantly, the results reveal that Ag0.125/Cu2O and Au0.6/Cu2O exhibit remarkably improved stability over that of Cu2O. This study presents a facile way to synthesize hierarchical noble metal-metal oxide composites for designing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "A Cu electrode modified with ultra-small Cu nanoparticles (~ 4 nm diameter) embedded in N-doped carbon arrays was fabricated using CuTCNQ arrays as a sacrificial template. The Cu@NC modified electrode enables highly controlled CO2 reduction to CO and formate in DMF (0.1 M Bu4NPF6) containing 0.5 vol% H2O and maintains stable catalytic activity for over 6 h under electrolytic conditions. The water content in the DMF electrolyte medium acts as the sole proton source for CO2 reduction, with a higher water content leading to the formation of more formate and hydrogen, and less CO. Under optimized conditions at 每2.4 V vs. Fc/Fc+ with 0.5 vol% water, a product distribution of 64% formate, 20% CO, and 13% H2 was obtained, which was rationalized by the competition of the CO and formate formation pathways. The CO-forming pathway lacks efficiency at low applied potential because the formation of *C2O4?每 is not thermodynamically favorable. However, at more negative potentials, the polarizable CO2﹞每 radical anion electrostatically interacts with the negative charge on the electrode surface. Control experiments and post-electrolysis analysis showed that the significantly higher catalytic current density and improved product selectivity of the Cu@NC array electrode could be attributed to its 3D micro structure and Cu nanoparticles embedded in the NC. This study demonstrates the potential for improving electrocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency through structural design of the catalyst. Finally, it is worth noting that this bottom-up synthetic method is applicable to other metal substrates, such as Ag, Ni and Zn [46, 47], that can spontaneously react with TCNQ to form nanostructured metal-TCNQ."

Specifically, a Cu foil was cleaned ultrasonically in acetone/ ethanol and rinsed with deionized water. Then, the cleaned Cu foil was dried with nitrogen and immersed into a mixed solution containing 0.13 M (NH4)2S2O8 and 2.66 M NaOH for 10 min. The deep-blue color foil (Cu(OH)2 NW array formed on the surface of the foil) was taken out from the solution, rinsed with deionized water/ethanol. To coat PTFE on the array surface, the as-prepared Cu(OH)2 NW array was soaked in PTFE solution (1 wt.%, 5 wt.%, 10 wt.%, and 20 wt.%) for 10 min, then annealed at 350 ～C for 30 min under an air atmosphere, forming PTFE-CuO NW array. The subsequent reducing procedure is conducted at 每0.7 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M KHCO3 for 10 min to reduce PTEF-CuO to PTFE-Cu. As a comparison, pristine Cu NW array was made following the same procedures but without coating with PTFE."

After annealing at 350 ～C, the Cu(OH)2 turned to CuO, as confirmed by the change of XRD patterns before and after annealling (Fig. S1 in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM)). The subsequent electrochemical reduction led to the formation of metallic Cu array, as evidenced by both XPS and XRD characterizations (Figs. S1 and S2 in the ESM). The SEM image confirmed the morphology of NW array after electrochemical reduction (Fig. 2(a)). The width of the nanowire was ~ 100 nm as revealed by TEM characterization of a single Cu wire peeled off from the array electrode (Fig. 2(b)). HRTEM showed obvious grain boundaries on the surface of Cu nanowire, suggesting polycrystalline nature of Cu NW (Fig. 2(c)) and the selected area electron diffraction results further confirmed its polycrystalline feature (Fig. S3 in the ESM). The electrode assembled by arrayed Cu NWs showed a superaerophobic surface, as evidenced by a contact angle of 154.4～ for CO2 gas bubbles on such a Cu array surface (Fig. 2(d)). Meanwhile, the contact angle for the 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution (i.e. CO2RR electrolyte) was 32.9～, revealing a hydrophilic state. This aerophobic surface nature facilitated the leaving of gas products thus giving a stable current density (Fig. 2(e)). However, when immersing the Cu NW array electrode in a 5% PTFE solution, a thin layer of PTFE was uniformly coated on the surface of Cu NWs (Fig. 2(b) and Fig. S4 in the ESM), which changed the affinity towards gaseous CO2 and electrolyte significantly (Fig. 2(f)). Meanwhile, both the Cu NW array structure and the surface electronic structure were maintained (Figs. S5 and S6 in the ESM). The contact angles for CO2 gas bubbles and electrolytes were measured to be 48.4～ and 136.6～, respectively, suggesting the surface turned from aerophobic/hydrohpilic to aerophilic/hydrophobic state. Such a gas affinitive surface would lead to a stronger bubble adhesion, and hold the gaseous products for a longer time during electrochemical CO2RR process. Thus, the bubbles were kept on the electrode surface till the size got bigger than 1 mm or more. When the size of product bubbles got large enough to detach, the working surface area recovered at the sudden moment of bubble releasing. Repeated accumulation and release caused fluctuations of current with sharp jump and steady decay (Fig. 2(g))."

The morphologies of the prepared electrodes were characterized by SEM, and the elemental composition of each prepared electrode was analyzed by EDS (Fig. 1). In Fig. 1, the Cu/Co atomic ratio is shown in the top-left corner of the SEM images and the preparation ratio (Cu/Co) is shown in brackets. The Cu/Co atomic ratio differs from the preparation ratio because Co is more electronegative than Cu. Moreover, the SEM images of the electrodes show that the morphologies changed with increasing Co content. The electrodeposited Cu electrode (Cu100) shows large grain aggregates, whereas the electrodeposited Co electrode (Co100) shows needle-like crystals (data not shown). The grain aggregates of the Cu-Co electrodes tend to become smaller and finer with increasing Co content. corresponding to Cu despite the presence of Co, as detected by EDS. These results suggested that Co is solid soluted in the Cu crystalline framework, i.e., formed a substitutional solid solution. Figure 3 shows the XPS spectra of the electrodes. The binding energies of Cu 2p in all the electrodes are similar and show no change in spite of Co inclusion. The binding energy of Co 2p was observed with increasing Co content."

Electropolishing is a wellknown technique that removes material from a metallic workpiece, reducing the surface roughness by leveling micro-peaks and valleys, improving the surface finish. So, Cu foil (approximately 1 cm ℅ 2.5 cm) was treated with electropolishing in 85% phosphoric acid at an applied bias at 4.0 V for 5 min, and subsequently rinsed with great amount deionized (DI) water and dried by N2. The imbedded structure bimetallic Sn-Cu catalyst (BM Sn-Cu) was electrochemically synthesized by a two-step process. Firstly, it carried out potentiostatically in 10 mM SnCl2 and 0.1 M KCl mixture aqueous solution at -0.6 V vs. Ag/ AgCl for 7 min at room temperature and was rinsed with DI water and dried by N2, thus Sn nanoparticle formed on substrate. Then the containing Sn nanoparticles substrate was carried out potentiostatically in 10 mM CuCl2 and 0.1 M KCl mixture aqueous solution through under-potential deposition, thus Cu formed embedded in Sn nanoparticles. The deposition potential of Cu was determined according to CV curve. The electrochemical deposition was conducted in a standard three electrode system with a working electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum counter electrode."

Figure 1b shows that the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of G-CuxO-2h, revealing a typical nanosheet-like morphology and porous structure, while Figure S3 shows the CuxO-2h appear aggregation to some extent after remove GO template. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) images (Figure 1c) reveal that C, O, and Cu elements are homogeneously distributed over the entire G-CuxO-2h sample, suggesting a uniform CuxO decoration on graphene oxides. The mass content of Cu in the samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), as shown in Table S1. We noted that there is no obvious difference of Cu content for all samples, indicating Cu element can be well maintained during reduction in H2. The high-resolution TEM image (Figure 1d) shows the lattice fringe spacings of 2.13 ? and 2.30 ?, corresponding to the (200) facet direction of Cu2O and the (111) facet direction of CuO, respectively.[6, 21] It suggests that the as-prepared G-CuxO-2h mainly consisted of Cu2O and CuO, which might be caused by the reduction treatment in H2 atmosphere. To further compare the effect of reduction time on the morphology, Figure S1 shows the SEM images of obtained GCuxO-T samples. As seen, all the samples exhibited similar structure, indicating that the samples can inherit the morphology and structure of GO template even after the reduction treatment in H2. We noted that G-CuxO-2.5h sample exhibited some aggregated nanoparticles at the surface, which might be caused by formation of Cu(0) after excessive reduction of Cu(I)."

In brief, a monolayer of ordered and close-packed PMMA nanosphere array was prepared on a clean glass slide driven by surface tension at the interface of water/glass/air (Scheme 1a).[51, 52] The PMMA array was then transferred and lifted off on the top of an aqueous solution containing polymer micelles (15 mg/mL). The array can float at the water-air interface due to the hydrophobic nature of PMMA nanospheres (Scheme 1b and c). The monolayer of the PMMA nanospheres was then picked up using a carbon paper electrode."

The XRD data and TEM photograph of the prepared nano titania indicate that the majority of the prepared nano titanium dioxide was in the anatase form with crystal size is 20-25 nm. Examination of the self-cleaning property of the modified PET fabrics with CTA and CD or gum and after treated with nano titania showed maximum dye removal of using CD was attained when nano titania cured with the modified PET fabrics for 25 min, while curing for 15 min is quite enough to reach the maximum % of dye release in case of gum. The PET fabrics treated with CTA-gym and after treated with nano titania shows higher ability to remove MB dye (95.5%) in comparison with those of CD-CTA (91.7%). The xanthan gum is able to maintain the bonded nano titania without noticeable decrease in the self cleaning property of the PET fabrics, even after 10 washing cycles."

Similar to the anodization experimental setup, the annealed foil was used as the cathode and platinum as the anode, separated by a distance of 1cm, and the foil was immersed into the electrolyte containing suspended nano silver [22] or/and nano gold particles. Nano silver or/and nano gold particles were uniformly adsorbed on the titania nanotubular surface by electrophoresis under applied electric field. The electrophoretic process was performed at 30 V for nano silver particle adsorption or at 10 V for nano gold particle adsorption for 15 min. The composite nano Ag/Au adsorption process followed the aforementioned procedure for each specimen."

These dramatic increases of the reduction Jpeak for both RT and MT at the PTH/GCE is attributed to the strong catalytic activity of PTH. In order to investigate the simultaneous determination of RT and MT, CV of the co-solution of RT and MT in PBS (pH 7.0) was measured (Fig. 2(C)). RT and MT showed two clearly distinguishable reduction peak without altering the reduction peak potential at PTH/GCE with a significant increase of reduction Jpeak , while the reduction of these two drugs at anodized GCE did not showed neither a well- separated peak nor an increased Jpeak. It is noteworthy that the oxidation and reduction peaks, observed at ca. 鈭?.24 and ca. 鈭?.28 V, respectively, were arisen from the PTH itself."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Overall, the growth mechanism has been difficult to elucidate due to the varied nature of each synthetic method. In short, there are three approaches in which CNTs are grown. The first of which takes large bulk carbons and atomizes them in a vacuum chamber. The atoms are then recombined upon cooling to form CNTs downstream of the atomization source. This breakdown of large carbons will be frequently addressed as the 鈥渢op-down鈥?approach. Common methods for this approach are an arc-discharge between graphite electrodes and a laser ablation of graphite rods. These techniques can produce large quantities of either SWNTs or MWCNTs (depending on specific parameters) but with a large distribution of sizes and a low purity. The second of these approaches takes small organic precursors and builds them up into the desired product, also known as the 鈥渂ottom-up approach鈥? This approach usually follows a scheme in which a mixture of hydrocarbon gas and an inert carrier gas is first pumped into a chamber. From here, popular methods for this kind of synthesis deviate greatly such as thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in which a tube furnace is used to initiate CNT growth; or microwave-assisted CVD in which microwave energy is used to generate a highly-reactive plasma. Many variations on the bottom-up approach can be employed such as using larger liquid-phase hydrocarbons through a bubbler system instead of gases, using a resistive material as the heat source to initiate reaction also known as the hot filament CVD method, or ultra-high vacuum (P < 10-6 Pa) to encourage rapid cooling from the heat source to the substrate for defect-free material growth. Overall, the bottom-up approach gives low to average yields, medium to high purity, and a narrower distribution of sizes compared to the top-down approach."

The acid-acetylene black mixture changed from a powdery black solution to a dark brown with small amounts of particulates over the four hour period. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was placed in an ice bath and slowly neutralized with KOH (solid pellet) until a large precipitation of salt was formed. The GQD-unreacted acetylene black and salt mixture was vacuum filtered through 2.5 碌m filter paper to remove most of the salt and large carbon particles. The neutralization and filtration processes were repeated until the stock GQD solution was pH = 6. Then, 25 mL of stock GQD solution was filtered through a 200 nm pore syringe filter to remove any remaining carbon microparticles. After the final filtration, a MWCO = 100-500 Da dialysis bag was filled with the syringe-filtered solution and dialyzed against ultrapure water for one week to remove dissolved salts. The resulting solution was used in this work as the GQD sample."

Overall, five samples were submitted with two distinct sample sets. In the first sample set, CQDs were made using a top-down approach by chemically oxidizing carbon nano-onions (CNOs) with nitric and sulfuric acid. In this case, sulfuric acid acts as an intercalating agent which assists in 鈥減eeling off鈥?layers of the carbon nano-onion. At the same time, nitric acid can strongly oxidize either the inherent defects of the CNO or the exposed edges of the carbon nano-onion layer. These two processes result in the formation of graphene quantum dots (GQDs). Generally, GQDs produced in this way are large, aromatic sp2-carbon planes about 5 to 10 nm in diameter with edges terminated with hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl functional groups. The number and proportion of these functional groups vary from particle to particle but can be quantitatively averaged using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Previous results with Atomic Force Microscopy suggest that the ox-GQD are not monodisperse but instead tend to aggregate into stacks of three to five."

The reaction was terminated when the reflux solution became clear and brownish in color. Afterwards, this solution was first centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 90 minutes to allow the precipitation of unreacted carbon nano-onions. Then, the supernatant was neutralized with K2CO3 and dialyzed for 6 days with a dialysis bag (1 kDa MWCO) to remove excess ions from the neutralization. After dialysis, the resulting solution contains the purified ox-GQD in water. N-GQDs were prepared by reacting ox-GQDs with NH4OH in a hydrothermal reactor, as similar to the report by Tetsuka et al7 First, ox-GQDs were mixed with 5.0 M NH4OH (1:2 v/v). The mixture was then placed into a 200 mL stainless steel autoclave reactor for 5 hours. The hydrothermal temperature of the reaction was varied from 90鈥?90 掳C. NGQD-X prepared at a specific temperature such as 150 掳C will now be referred as NGQD-150. A simplified scheme of this procedure is shown below in Scheme 3.1."

About 1 minute after t0, a uniformly pale yellow liquid is observed. The pyrolytic reaction was quenched by adding 100 mL of 0.1 M KOH solution. The obtained CNDs were labeled as 鈥? min CNDs鈥? These CNDs seem to be a loose polymer of carbonized citric acid with a mixture of sp2- and sp3-hybridized carbon. The proposed structure of 1 min CNDs can be seen in Scheme 1. When the reaction continues to pyrolyze without KOH quenching, the color of the liquid changes from pale yellow to bright yellow, to orange, and finally to orange-red. The observed color change is consistent with the previous work by Dong et al and is indicative of newly formed C-C sp2-hybridized carbon.1 At 10 minutes after t0, the liquid becomes a deep red indicating more complete carbonization of CNDs. Any longer carbonization than 15 minutes using hotplate pyrolysis dries the product out and can burn the product. This can still create quantum dots, but their solubility in water is reduced and their photoluminescence was found to be negligible. The carbonization of CNDs is quenched by 100 mL of 0.1 M KOH solution and the resultant CNDs are labeled as 鈥?0 min CNDs鈥? In order to remove the excess ions K+ and OH-, dialysis was performed on 1 min and 10 min CNDs using 1 kDa MWCO dialysis membranes for about 3 days. Both 1 min CNDs and 10 min CNDs were treated with aqueous ammonia in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave reactor. The nitrogendoped CNDs are referred to as 鈥? min NCNDs鈥?and 鈥?0 min NCNDs鈥? The hydrothermal treatment was conducted for 5 hours at 180 掳C. The NCNDs were subjected to the same dialysis procedure to remove excess ammonia. All of the hydrothermally treated CNDs have a control solution of 1 min CNDs and 10 min CNDs that were subjected to the same hydrothermal conditions but in the absence of aqueous ammonia. These are referred to as 鈥? min HT-CNDs鈥?and 鈥?0 min HT-CNDs鈥? respectively."

This approach was chosen in order to investigate whether the nanoparticle size of the CuO@C sample could be maintained in the CuS@C and Cu2S@C samples. Figure 1 shows the X-ray diffractograms of CuO@C, CuS@C, Cu2S@C and of bare carbon as a reference. For all four samples, diffraction lines are observed at 30.6～ and 64.1～, which can be ascribed to the crystalline graphite support, which clearly was not damaged by the treatments. The CuO@C sample shows additional diffraction lines at 41.5～, 45.3～ and 57.0～, which can be indexed with the monoclinic structure of CuO (PDF-01-070-6831 (ICDD, 2019) [30]). Upon sulfidation using thioacetamide, the diffraction pattern shows clear diffraction lines at 34.1～, 37.1～, 38.3～ and 56.3～, which is consistent with the hexagonal CuS covellite structure (PDF-00-006-0464 (ICDD, 2019) [30]). The formation of metal sulfides using TAA has been described before and two different mechanisms are proposed.[31每33] CuS can be formed in a direct reaction, via the formation and subsequent decomposition of Cu-TAA complexes, or via a hydrolysis reaction, where the hydrolysis of TAA yields H2S and H2S subsequently reacts with Cu2+ (either dissolved or in CuO nanoparticles) to form CuS."

All electrochemical measurements were conducted with a CHI-760D electrochemical workstation using a single-compartment electrochemical cell at room temperature. Reference electrode was a Ag/AgCl electrode and counter electrode was a Pt wire. For working electrode, Pt/C ink was cast on a glassy carbon electrode (diameter = 3 mm) by two methods. The first was a two-step method. The dispersion of Pt/C (5 mg/mL in DI water) was ultrasonicated for 1 h to obtain homogeneous catalyst ink. Then, 6 碌L ink was dropped on the surface of glassy carbon. After being air dried, 5 碌L 0.5 wt% Nafion was added to cover the surface of electrodes. The second is a one-step method. The mixture of Pt/C (5 mg/mL) and Nafion (volume ratio of Nafion to water is 1:9) was prepared and thoroughly sonicated. Then, the ink (6 碌L) was dropped on the surface of glassy carbon. After being air dried, the electrode was immediately tested without further Nafion addition. An electrolyte solution was either N2 or O2 purged before and during electrochemical measuring. Electrochemically surface area (ECSA) was calculated by cyclic voltammetric measurements. The durability test was conducted at -0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with 1600 rpm rotation in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH for 20000s. Finally, Pt/C was treated by cycling a potential of -0.2 to 1.0 V in N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 at a scan rate of 0.1 V/s. volammetric (LSV) curves of Pt/C in 0.1 M KOH before and after ADT. The potential is relative to Ag/AgCl reference. An ADT is executed by holding the potential at -0.4 V for 20000 sec. The CVs include the features of hydrogen adsorption (Hads) and desorption (Hupd) peaks in the potential range from -0.9 to -0.5 V. The formation of Pt oxide and its reduction are found in the potential range from -0.3 to -0.1 V.121-122 The ECSA is estimated by counting the charge of hydrogen desorption (Hupd) in the CV curve (shown in Figure 4.1a), based on the following equation: where mPt is a platinum loading (mg) on the electrode, QH is the charge for hydrogen desorption ( C), and Qref is 0.21 mg/cm2, which represents charge for the adsorption of H2 monolayer on the surface of Pt123. A larger ECSA suggests more catalytic sites for electrochemical reaction.14 A previous report suggests the loss of ECSA is the main reason for fuel cell performance degradation.14 Compared to the initial ECSA of Pt/C (59.1 卤 4.5 m2/g), the catalyst loses 10.3% ECSA after 20000 s chronoamperometric i-t test (Figure 4.1a). A half-wave potential is shifted to the negative direction by ~40 mV, which is consistent with a previous report.124 An onset potential in the LSV is also negatively shifted by ~10 mV (Figure 4.1b). Despite the reduction of ECSA and the shift of the onset potential, Pt/C maintains 95.2卤1.0 % of current intensity after ADT. This result is significantly better than the values (45-70 %) of Pt/ C reported in previous literature (Table 4.1)."

The reference electrode was a Ag/AgCl (in 1 M KCl) electrode while the counter electrode was a Pt wire. For the working electrode, n-CNOs were cast on planar glassy carbon current collector (diameter = 4 mm). 0.1 M KHCO3 was dissolved in water as an electrolyte. The catalytic performance of n-CNOs was evaluated by CV. The n-CNO working electrode was prepared as follows. n-CNO (2 mg/mL) dispersion was obtained by mixing 6 mg n-CNOs with 3 ml de-ionized water with 50 碌L of 5 wt% Nafion. A catalyst ink was obtained by ultrasonicating n-CNO in water for 1 h. Afterwards, 40 碌L of the ink was dropped on glassy carbon electrode. Then, the electrode was dried before electrochemical characterizations. The electrolyte was purged with CO2 for 30 minutes before each measurement. The flow rate of CO2 gas was maintained at 57 sccm to ensure that the electrolyte was saturated with CO2. Cyclic voltammograms were also recorded with N2-saturated electrolyte for comparison."

A 0.1 M copper sulfate pentahydrate with 1 wt% fructose and 0.2 M KOH were used to produce the nanoparticles. The resulting yellow coloured slurry was cleaned and the solids were freezedried. The powder XRD pattern confirmed the presence of pure phase Cu2O with a cubic structure, similar to the standard reference pattern for Cu2O (JCPDS 01-071-3645) (Figure 2 a)). The pattern showed the existence of only the Cu2O phase with no secondary phases from CuO or Cu metal, confirming that the short residence time within the first CJM was sufficient to form pure-phase Cu2O. The sharp peaks indicated the particles were crystalline in nature and the application of the Scherrer equation resulted in a crystallite size of 35 nm. Surface analysis of the Cu2O sample showed the existence of Cu2O (peak 2p3/2 at 932.3 eV) but also the presence of CuO phase, as confirmed from the satellite peaks and the presence of the 2p3/2 peak at 934.8 eV corresponding to CuO (Figure 2 b)). The existence of CuO in the surface analysis suggests the presence of an amorphous CuO layer on the surface of the Cu2O nanoparticles, which was likely not seen in the XRD due to its amorphous nature. This is expected as the surface undergoes oxidation from Cu2O to form amorphous CuO due to the unstable Cu + oxidation state. As-synthesised nano-powders were also characterised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 2 c)) where round crystalline nanoparticles were observed. Bersani et al. synthesized CuO nanoparticles using CHFS where the nanoparticles were crystalline with diameter of 11 ㊣ 4 nm from TEM [14]. The electrochemical behaviour of the as-prepared Cu2O nanoparticles was subsequently examined to evaluate the performance of Cu2O nanoparticles for CO2 conversion."

A solution of Al(OH)A% was prepared by dissolving 1.21 g of Al(NO3) 3路9H2O in 8 mL of 2.0 M NaOH. The addition of Al(OH)A% solution to pre-diluted Na2SiO3 under continuous stirring, produced a cloudy gel that was left standing without stirring for 1 h before further use. The gel was stabilized with 1 mL of concentrated HNO3 before addition of 4.81 g of Zn(NO3)2路6H2O dissolved in 100 mL water. The synthesis was performed under reflux at 90 掳C, unless noted otherwise, by augmenting the gel with the sodium salt of succinic acid to reach a concentration in the range 0.010鈥?.0 M. Alternatively, formic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, or L-malic acid sodium salts were also employed (Supplementary Information)."

The solution was stirred using glass rod and the dish containing solution was introduced in a muffle furnace preheated at 300oC. The solution led to dehydration followed by combustion without any appearance of flame. Sample was ground in a mortar-pestle and calcined at 900oC for 10 hours to obtain the required polycrystalline sample. The synthesis reaction for the formation of La2CuO4 is given as: 2 La(NO3)3 + Cu(NO3)2 + 6.66 NH2CONH2  La2CuO4 + 10.66 N2 + 13.32 H2O + 6.66 CO2 ----- (1) Combustion synthesized La2CuO4 was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer in the range of 20每80～. The Rietveld refinement was 5 performed using the FullProf-fp2k program varying different parameters simultaneously such as overall scale factor and background correction factor."

Both the microemulsions were left stirring for 30 min. so as to obtain optically clear homogeneous dispersions. RM-2 was then added to RM-1 drop-wise with continuous stirring. The resulting solution was left for stirring for another 3 h to allow the growth of Cu nanoparticles to its completion which is termed as ※Ostwald ripening§. A nitrogen atmosphere was maintained throughout the process to ensure the complete removal of oxygen thereby preventing the oxidation of the metal. Instantaneous development of brown colour indicated the formation of the copper nanoparticles."

Then, the reactor is connected to the experimental setup, purged with CO2 (at cylinder pressure ~60 bar) and heated up. Once the reactor reaches the set-point temperature (200 oC) the pressure of CO2 is increased by pumping up to 100 bar and maintained at these conditions (in batch mode) for 60 minutes to achieve the dissolution of the metal precursor. Then, hydrogen is introduced inside the reactor and pressure is increased up to 250 bar for 30 minutes to reduce the metal precursor to its metallic form. Finally, and once the reactor is depressurized, the product obtained is vacuum filtered (0.45 米m Nylon) and the catalyst obtained is then dried in an oven at 40 oC during 24 hours."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "The experimental procedure carried out for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide has been described in previous works [21,23]. The catalysts obtained from the supercritical fluid deposition have been used to prepare a catalytic ink. This ink is then sprayed on two pieces of carbon paper (Toray? Teflon TM treated) using an airbrush to form the catalytic layer of the GDE. A metal load of 0.4 mg of metal cm-2 has been deposited for each electrode. Both pieces of carbon paper are then assembled to both sides of a Nafion? 117 membrane (in contact with the catalytic layer) by hot pressing. This assembly is set in the PEM type cell. To carry out the electroreduction experiments, a KHCO3 solution is circulated through the anodic part of the electrochemical cell while a continuous CO2 flowrate is passed on the cathodic flow channel of the cell. The experiments are made under galvanostatic operation mode for two hours. Gas products obtained are circulated to the GC while liquids are collected in a cold trap for further analysis by SPME in the GC. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization of Cu/CNT catalysts synthesized Transmission electronic microscopy, X-ray diffraction and ICP have been used to characterize the Cu/CNT catalyst developed in this work. Figure 1 shows two of the micrographs taken using TEM as well as the nanoparticle size distribution obtained from the micrographs. As it can be appreciated in figure 1a, copper nanoparticles (black dots in the image) seem to be homogenously dispersed onto the carbon nanotubes surface. In addition, Figure 1b shows that the size of the nanoparticles formed can be small enough to be deposited inside the carbon nanotubes (inner diameter of 4.5 nm ㊣ 0.5 nm according to the supplier). The size distribution of the copper nanoparticles confirms these observations. As it can be seen in figure 1c most of the particles have a mean diameter between 1.5 and 5 nm showing a normal distribution with most of the particles with diameters around 2 and 3 nm. Furthermore, around 14 % of the nanoparticles have a mean diameter above 6 nm, in some cases due to the agglomeration of nanoparticles."

Cu foam with a thickness of 80 米m (MTI Corp USA) was successively washed with acetone (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9 %), ultrapure water (18.2 M次 cm -1 at 25 ～C, Millipore Milli-Q system), and 3.0 M HCl (Fluka, 37 %) for 30 min under ultrasonic condition to remove organic contaminants and possible oxide layers on the surface. After then, it was rinsed with ultrapure water and dried at 80 ～C in a vacuum oven, before using it as the working electrode. A three-electrode setup was used with a carbon rod as counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl/Sat. KCl as reference electrode, connected to an IM6ex electrochemical workstation (Zahner). The electrolyte was 1.0 M KOH (Merck) solution, which was deaerated by bubbling N2 for at least 30 min before experiments. The Cu foam was electrochemically anodized at room temperature and constant current density of 10 mA cm -2 for 10 min to form Cu(OH)2 NWs. After anodization, samples were rinsed with ultrapure water and annealed at 150 ～C for 1.5 h under static air, to dehydration of Cu(OH)2 to CuO. Atomic layer deposition of TiO2 was conducted on a Beneq thin-film system (TFS 200, Beneq Corporation), according to a previous work [23]. TiO2 was deposited using titanium isopropoxide (C12H28O4Ti ≡ 97 %, Sigma Aldrich) as precursor, and distilled water (H2O) as oxidizing agent, at 225 ～C. Ultrahigh purity nitrogen was used as reactant carrier and purge gas, and the reactor was maintained at 400 Pa."

The Cu2O每GDEs contain 1 mg cm 2 of metal particles. The catalyst loading was kept at 1 mg cm 2 of Cu2O and 1 mg cm 2 of ZnO for the Cu2O/ZnO electrodes. These catalytic loading and weight ratio were observed to be the optimal for the reaction under study [11].

        "synthesis_paragraph": "The micro-strains inside the catalysts were introduced by a facile, fast cooling approach. In brief, copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles were first synthesized and annealed at a high temperature (500 oC), and then was cooled down at different rates under various cooling environments (Figure 1a). For the super-fast cooling rate, the CuO nanoparticles were cooled in liquid N2 (?196 oC) to obtain the target catalyst, named CuO-FC (where FC indicates fast cooling rate). For comparison, the CuO nanoparticles were also cooled down by water (i.e., medium cooling rate, designated as CuO-MC) or hot air (i.e., slow cooling rate, designated as CuO-SC). The crystalline phases of these obtained samples were first characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure 2a). All the three samples presented sharp diffraction peaks that were characteristic for the crystal structure of monoclinic CuO (PDF: 89-5895). No clear 6 differences were observed in the peak positions. This result suggested that the different cooling treatments did not alter their phases or crystal structures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that all these CuO samples were composed of many interconnected irregularly nano-crystallines, with average sizes of ~ 50 nm (Figure 2b-d). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images exhibited similar nano-crystalline morphologies of these samples. However, a slight decrease of the particle size was observed with the increase of the cooling rate (Figure 2e-g, Figure S1). This slight reduction of particle size may be possibly ascribed to the fact that the fast cooling rate can limit the atomic transfer rate in the Ostwald Ripening process, and thus impede the material growth.27 In addition, many GBs were clearly observed in these small CuO nanoparticles. The CuO-FC sample presented a highest density of these GBs (as shown in red dashed box in Fig. 2g). As reported by previous literature,21 this high density of GBs was beneficial for transforming into a grainboundary-rich (GB-rich) Cu crystal structure during the subsequent electrochemical reduction of CuO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was then conducted to further study the electronic structures of these samples. For the Cu 3d spectra (Figure 2h), the peaks at ca. 954.2 and 934.1 eV corresponded to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of CuO.28 The three peaks of 962.3, 944.0 and 941.5 eV were assigned to the satellite signals of Cu2+.28 The O 1s spectrum can be de-convoluted into two distinct sub-peaks at 531.8 and 530.0 eV (Figure 2i), which were ascribed to the surface oxygen and lattice oxygen in CuO.29 The XPS results suggest that no clear electron transfer was observed between Cu and neighboring atoms.30 The atomic ratios between Cu and O elements in the three CuO samples were listed (Table S1). In addition, the ratios of the lattice oxygen and surface oxygen were 1.3, 1.33, and, 1.43, respectively (Table S2). The results indicated that no obvious oxygen vacancies existed, and were different from previous work of oxygen vacancies in TiO2.29, 31 This phenomenon difference can be attributed to the lower oxygen vacancy formation energy in TiO2.32 In addition, the lattice strains induced by alloying or lattice mismatch at epitaxial interfaces typically show an obvious shift of 7 the shell electron energy.33-35 However, the micro-strains are more associated with surface or bulk defects and thus do not present such a trend.36 To investigate the micro-strains by different cooling treatments, XRD collected using synchrotron light source (SXRD) was further conducted to measure these samples (Figure 3a-c). The two-theta XRD patterns derived from the SXRD results were displayed (Figure S2), and the plane distances were calculated by using Bragg equation 2dsin牟 = n竹, which were consistent with the results of the aforementioned 2- dimensional XRD (Figure 2a). The data of the SXRD were analyzed using Williamson?Hall analysis.18, 21 The scatters corresponded to each peak of the CuO samples were displayed (Figure 3d). A linear fitting was obtained and attributed to the following correlation: Bcos牟 = K竹/D + 4e*sin牟, where D is the average crystallite size, 竹 is the wavelength, e is the non-uniform strain (micro-strain), and the Scherrer constant K = 1.18, 21 The slopes of the linear fitting represented the micro-strains, and the crystallite sizes were calculated from the intercepts. The linear fitting results were summarized (Figure 3e), which showed an increasing slope with the cooling rate increase. Thus, CuO-FC exhibited the largest micro-strains. Meanwhile, CuO-FC also presented the largest intercept of the linear fittings, indicating the smallest crystallite size. The detailed fitting results of these three CuO samples were summarized (Table S3). The average sizes of the CuO-SC, CuO-MC and CuO-FC nanoparticles were 40.5, 35.8 and 35.3 nm, respectively. The effect of tuning the micro-strains and GBs in the CuO catalysts on the ECR performance was then investigated. Due to the low solubility of CO2 in aqueous solutions, the conventional H-type electrochemical cell can only have limited activities.37 In addition, the longer mass transportation path made the lower overpotential reaction of HER easier.38 Thus, the flow-cell with gas-diffusion layer (GDL) and high alkaline (1 M KOH) were used instead. About 0.25 mg﹞cm-2 of CuO catalyst was loaded onto the GDL. Before the ECR measurement, all the three CuO catalysts were electrochemically reduced to form pure copper (Figure S3). TEM images show that all the Cu catalysts were homogeneously dispersed on the edge of 8 porous carbon (Figure S4). High-resolution TEM images show that there was little reconstruction of catalysts, with the GBs still being clearly observed. Different orientations of Cu (100) and (110) were observed (Figure S4d), suggesting that different crystallite domains co-existed to form micro-strains. The electrochemical performances of these samples were first investigated by measuring the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles. The results displayed characteristic peaks between ?0.3 and 0.5 V vs. RHE (Figure S5). The positive potential could be attributed to the reduce reaction of Cu2+ to Cu,38 and the negative potential was the water splitting into the hydrogen. The ECR activity was then measured under different applied potentials between ? 0.3 and ?1.2 V (vs. RHE, with iR-correction). For CuOSC, CuO-MC and CuO-FC, different products selectivity distribution of each electrocatalyst were displayed versus the applied potential (Figure 4a-c). The comparison of different samples was conducted within the limited potential difference. It can be seen that the H2 formation was maintained low with the FEs of < 20%, partially attributed to the pH effect in a high alkaline electrolyte.38 For all these three catalysts, CO, C2H4 and C2H5OH were the main ECR products. The ECR total current densities were close to 300 mA cm-2 at about ?1.0 V vs. RHE. The onset potentials of C2 products (C2H4 and C2H5OH) were relatively more negative than those of C1 products, as the C?C coupling process is generally more sluggish.40 The partial current densities of C2 products were 246.3 (for CuO-MC) and 240.8 mA﹞cm-2 (for CuO-FC). The densities were 1.31 and 1.29 times higher than that of CuO-SC (186.9 mA﹞cm-2). In addition, a clear difference of ethanol (C2H5OH) and ethylene (C2H4) was also observed. CuO-FC presented an FE as high as 35.7% for ethanol production with a partial current density of 127.2 mA﹞cm-2. In contrast, CuO-MC exhibited an FE of only 18.6% for ethanol production, but with a partial current density of 179.9 mA﹞cm-2 for producing ethylene (Table S4-S6). The Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of the total C2 products of different samples were further plotted with the applied potentials (Figure 4d). When the potential was less negative than ?0.6 V, CuO-SC possessed a relatively high FE of C2 products. This is 9 because more unsaturated Cu sites in the smaller particle sizes of Cu-MC and Cu-FC resulted in higher H2 production at this potential range.41 At more negative applied potentials when the thermodynamic energy became more dominating for C?C coupling, both CuO-MC and CuO-FC showed better selectivities for C2 products at this potential range. The ratios between C2 and C1 products were displayed to show this trend (Figure 4e). In spite that CuO-FC had similar partial current densities for C2 formation as those of CuO-MC, the CuO-FC sample presented the largest ratios between C2 and C1 products in most of the potentials. For example, at ?0.8 V vs. RHE, the ratio between C2 and C1 products was 7.04 for CuO-FC, substantially exceeding that of CuO-MC (4.48) and CuO-SC (2.00). This clear increase of C2 product formation suggests that micro-strains induced by fast cooling rate can help to stabilize the main intermediate toward C2 production, that is, *CO,37 and thus the subsequent C?C coupling steps. Moreover, the ratios between ethanol and C2H4 products were further compared among these three catalysts (Figure 4f). It can be seen that CuO-FC presented the highest ratio between ethanol and C2H4, with a peak value of 1.4 at ?0.85 V vs. RHE. As suggested by recent literatures,42, 43 the improvement of *CO adsorption can lead to a higher surface coverage of *CO intermediate, favoring the subsequent oxygenate formation toward ethanol. To confirm our findings, we conducted another set of experiments by first reduced the CuO nanoparticles into Cu at high temperature, followed by fast cooling (using liquid nitrogen) or slow cooling (using natural room temperature), designated as CuFC and Cu-SC, respectively. XRD and corresponding Williamson-Hall analysis also demonstrated a similar trend that the Cu-FC obtained from fast cooling showed a higher density of micro-strains (Figure S6). The electrochemical CO2 reduction measurement using these catalysts demonstrated results of increased C2 products by fast-cooling Cu catalyst (Figure S7), similar to those of aforementioned CuO ones. Simultaneously, CuO (800)-FC was obtained by the same treatment with CuO annealed at 800 oC, which showed no obvious performance enhancement compared to CuO-FC (Figure S8). It demonstrated that a higher annealing temperature led a reduction of active sites.18"

The synthesis schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 1a. First, KBH4 is added into AgNO3, and the solution quickly turns black. After addition of Cu(NO3)2, the hydrogel is obtained by standing for 8 h, washed with water in depth and then dried by a freeze dryer to acquire bimetallic aerogel. Fig. 1b-d are scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of Ag100, Ag88Cu12 and Ag50Cu50, showing analogical porous structure, which indicates aerogel structure is not affected by metal ratio and can be universally feasible. The formation of these pores maybe caused by the large amount of overflowing H2 generated while reducing Ag+ and Cu2+ by KBH4. The three-dimensional porous network structure is the most important feature of aerogel materials[38] suggesting the successful preparation of our Ag-Cu bimetallic aerogel. Compared with onedimensional and two-dimensional materials, aerogel has unique advantages in catalysis. The large number of pores in Ag88Cu12 can supply more reaction sites for eCO2RR, and provide transfer channels for unreacted CO2 and generated CO to facilitate the diffusion of gas molecules, which favors its high activity and selectivity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) further illustrates the successful synthesis of aerogel materials. Aerogel has three types of linkage: (1) bridge, applying to that the average size of the particle joint is smaller than the particle diameter, (2) ligament (size equal to the particle diameter) and (3) island (size larger than particle diameter)[39]. It is confirmed from Fig. 1e that Ag88Cu12 aerogel is composed of nanoparticles connected by ligaments with a porous network structure. As to the high-resolution TEM (Fig. 1f), it can be seen that a large number of grain boundaries are detected in the bimetallic aerogel. The lattice d-spacing of 0.232 nm corresponds to the face-centered-cubic structure of Ag(111)[40] which is further confirmed by the X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 2a), and the lattice d-spacing of 0.208 nm corresponds to the Cu(111)[38] (insert of Fig. 1f). STEM high-angle annular dark field-energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (HAADF-EDX) mapping pictures show that the distribution of Ag and Cu is uniform (Fig. 1g, Fig. S1). The value of BET specific surface area, pore volume and pore size of the bimetallic aerogel catalyst tested by liquid N2 adsorptiondesorption experiment can be seen in the Table S1. The BET surface area and pore size of Ag100, Ag88Cu12, and Ag50Cu50 are 3.04, 8.29, 9.25 m2 g 1 and 4.86, 5.49, 5.12 nm, respectively. Their nitrogen adsorption and desorption curves and pore size distribution are shown in Fig. S2."

This solution was dried in an oven at 85 C for over 12 h. The weight percent of Cu metal to fumed silica in the precursor was varied (5, 10, 20, & 30 wt% Cu: EH-5). Particles are designated as Cu1 (5 wt%), Cu2 (10 wt%), Cu3 (20 wt%), and Cu4 (30 wt%). The dried precursor was ground into a fine powder and reduced in a hydrogen environment (100 cc min 1) up to 250 C (ramp rate: 10 C min 1) for 2 h. The reduced powders were cooled to room temperature and the reaction chamber was sealed with Parafilm? and allowed to equilibrate with an oxygen containing environment (air) for 7 d. The reduced powders were combined with a potassium hydroxide solution (7 M, KOH pellets: EMD, 85%, 25 mL) and etched for 12 h. The nanoparticles were rinsed with ultrapure water until pH neutral (pH = 7) then separated from solution using centrifugal force and dried at room temperature."

After complete reduction, a specific amount of ZnO is added to disperse the particles. The Cu oxides/ZnO particles weight ratio is 1:4. Subsequently, and after alternating magnetic stirring with ultrasounds for 1 h, acetone is added to the solution to break the microemulsion, causing phase separation. Afterwards, the precipitated obtained is filtered, washed several times with acetone and ultrapure water. Finally, the resulting precipitate is dried at 70 ～C in a laboratory oven."

The product was washed with methanol to remove unreacted reagents. Bi-based MOF, named as CAU-17, was prepared following the synthetic procedure described elsewhere [64]. Basically, Bi(NO3)3﹞5H2O (1.03mmol) and H3BTC (1.17mmol) were added to a 70m L-teflon reactor along with 20mL of CH3OH, and heated to 120 ～C in a microwave oven during 20min. The precipitate was filtered off, washed with methanol and dried at room temperature. MOF samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) on a Phillips X'PERT diffractometer (equipped with Cu-K汐 radiation, 竹=1.5418 ?) over the range 5 < 2牟<70～ with a step size of 0.02～ at 293 K. The permanent porosity was studied by measuring N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K using a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ-MP analyzer. Microstructural features of MOFs and their dispersion were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using a JEOL JSM-7000 F microscope operated at 10每20 kV. Specimens were mounted on conductive carbon adhesive tabs and imaged after chromium sputter coating of 5 nm to make them conductive."

The pretreated substrates were thus used as the cathodes in a two-electrode electrochemical cell, while the anode was a Cu foil, which was pretreated using the same polishing and etching procedure. The two electrodes (cathode and anode) were fixed at a separation distance of 1 cm. A mixture of 0.4M Cu(CH3COO)2, 1.5M H2SO4 and 50mM HCl was used as the electrolyte [50]. The electrochemical deposition of Cu was performed under the application of a constant current (1.2 A) for times of 1, 2 and 4min. After the deposition, the materials were cleaned using distilled water, dried at 80 ～C overnight and then calcined at 200 ～C (5 ～Cmin?1 rate) for 1 h. The final supported Cu electrocatalyst appeared as a dark brown-black electrode. Similarly, Fe electrocatalysts were prepared on Fe, Fe-Cr-Ni alloy and Al substrates using 0.4 M FeSO4 (FeII) as the Fe precursor."

Importantly, unlike similar DC electrophoreticdissolution/deposition methods reported in the literature, no harsh and stringent variables were employed in the present synthesis. Typically, a copper rod with 6mm diameter (sacrificial anode) was first cleaned in 0.1 M HNO3 and rinsed thoroughly with deionised water. A platinum wire loop with 2mm diameter (deposition substrate cathode) was cleaned in 0.1 M HCl for 20 s and then rinsed thoroughly with water. Keithley 2231A-30-3 triple channel DC power supply from Tektronix Inc. USA that can be operated under constant voltage or current was used as a voltage source. The positive terminal was connected to copper rod whereas negative terminal was connected to Pt wire loop cathode immersed in a conventional glass electrochemical cell containing ascorbic acid solution in water and DC voltage was applied for the stipulated time interval. With time, the colour of the solution changes from colourless to pale blue (cyan) initially then to reddish brown suggesting the dissolution of metallic copper as copper ions into electrolyte solution followed by nucleation and growth of Cu-microstructures. Accumulation of a brownish mass of copper particles at the Pt cathode was also observed at a later part of the electrolysis. The obtained suspension was collected, centrifuged for 10min, washed with Milli-Q water several times followed by ethanol and then dried in a petri dish under vacuum at 50 ～C for ca. 3 h. Several samples were prepared following the similar approach but varying the electrolysis parameters viz. applied voltage, L-ascorbic acid additive concentration, electrolysis time and temperature, one at a time. Based on the parameter of impact under consideration, four different batches of the deposits, with operations employed tabulated in Table SI-1 and described briefly as below were prepared."

A detailed description of the synthesis method is provided in the Experimental Section. Three kinds of Cu@CuEu NPs that were denoted as Cu@CuEu-1 NPs, Cu@CuEu-2 NPs, and Cu@CuEu-3 NPs were prepared by controlling Eu/Cu precursor ratios at 1:9, 1:4, and 1:1 (Table S1), respectively. The metal contents of core/shell Cu@CuEu NPs were analyzed via inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP每OES). The bulk Eu/Cu ratios of the NPs were 0.052:1, 0.109:1, and 0.571:1 (Table S2). The atomic ratios of surface Eu/Cu for Cu@CuEu-1 NPs, Cu@CuEu-2 NPs, and Cu@CuEu-3 NPs collected through XPS were 0.50:1, 0.86:1, and 1.82:1 (Table S3), respectively. These results showed that three kinds of Cu@CuEu NPs with different shell contents were obtained by using the synthesis method reported here."

The pretreated Cu foil was placed in the reaction solution (0.1 M NH4SO3 in 2.5 M NaOH) for 30 min, after that the surface of the Cu foil turned to blue. Then the sample was washed by DI water and dried in the air. To synthesize Cu nanowires, the sample was further immersed in 50 mL of 0.5 M NaBH4 with stirring for about 2 h, rinsed by DI water and dried in a vacuum oven. Finally, the Cu(OH)2 was reduced to Cu and the surface of sample changed to puce. Cu nanowires were successfully synthesized on both sides of Cu foil."

SnCl2 was dissolved in the above solution to form the electroplating solution with a concentration of 0.018 M, which was stirred at least 10 h before the electrodeposition. With a Pt foil (4 cm2) counter electrode, Sn catalyst was electrodeposited on the surface of copper nanowires by applying a constant current density (3 mA cm? 2) for 15 min. The obtained sample was denoted as Sn/Nano-Cu. In addition, a Sn/Cu electrode as well as a commercial Sn foil electrode was employed as contrast samples. The same electrodeposition process was performed directly on the Cu foil to prepare the Sn/Cu electrode. The Sn foil was only cleaned in ethanol, acetone and DI water in turn."

The crucible filled with the metal powders was heated to 750 ?C and kept at that temperature for 10 min before cooling down naturally in the furnace. The resulting Al2Cu ingot was pre-crushed (Retsch BB50 Jaw Crusher) to particles smaller than 2 mm. The ball milling process (2000 rpm for 8 h) was performed using a Retsch Emax ball mill. 12 mL of the pre-crushed Al2Cu powder and 30 mL 2 mm zirconia grinding balls were mixed in a 50 mL zirconia grinding jar. For ECR testing, we dealloyed 2 g of the resulting Al2Cu powder in 50 mL of 6 M KOH solution until hydrogen evolution was no longer observed. To avoid violent reaction and splattering the powder was added slowly to the KOH solution. The resulting npCu powder was rinsed several times with DI water and dried in a vacuum desiccator before further characterization and testing. Particle size analysis of the as-prepared Al2Cu powder was performed using a laser scattering particle size distribution analyzer (HORIBA LA-960). Microstructural characterization of both as-milled and dealloyed samples was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL 7410) with lower secondary electron detector at an accelerating voltage of 5? 10 keV and a working distance of 8 mm."

Four 25 cm2 GDLs (Sigracet, 39BCE) were fixed on a substrate using scotch tape and coated with the npCu/isopropyl alcohol suspension using a handheld airbrush (Fig. 1b and c). The manual airbrush technique used in this work resulted in non-uniform catalysts coatings as indicted by color variations of the coated GDL. The npCuGDL cathode assemblies were integrated into a 25 cm2 Opus 12 Inc. gas diffusion electrolyzer using an Aemion? AF1-HNN8? 50-X alkaline exchange membrane (AEM) (Ionomr Innovations Inc.) to separate the npCu-coated GDL cathode from the IrOx-coated porous Ti anode. The cell configuration is similar to that described in our previous work on CO2 to CO reduction using a nanoporous Au catalyst [30], and a schematic representation of the setup can be found in Fig. 1d. The cathode-AEM-anode assembly was then compressed between two flow fields against the respective cell current collectors. A CO2 flow rate of 250 sccm was used on the cathode side of the cell while 0.5 M KOH was circulated via a peristaltic pump on the anode side at 60 mL/min. Electrolysis was run in constant current mode with 35-minute holds at 25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 mA/cm2. The as-generated gas products were measured with an in-line gas chromatograph (GC, SRI 8610C) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for measuring CO, CH4, C2H4, and H2 yields, respectively. The GC sampled the gas phase products every seven minutes and five data points were recorded for each current density. Here, we report the averaged selectivity and partial current densities (with the corresponding error bars) of the above GC-detected gas products. Liquid products are not reported here as the electrolyzer design used in this work did not allow for catholyte collection."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "A simple MOF-derivatised strategy was adopted to obtain Cu/ Cu2O@NG materials, in which MOF-199 was electroreduced to Cu/ Cu2O particles on NG. All electrochemical experiments were performed using a CHI 660D electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd.). 0.2 M KI aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte solution in all experiments. Typically, 10 mg mixture of MOF-199 and NG (mass ratio = 4:1) were dispersed uniformly in a solution containing 30 米L Nafion? 117 and 60 米L water by ultrasonication for 0.5 h. The suspension of MOF-199 and NG was coated on a carbon paper (area= 1.77 cm2), which was named MOF-199-NG/carbon paper. Then, Cu/ Cu2O@NG-2 was obtained by chronoamperometry at -1.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) for 5 min by using the MOF199-NG/carbon paper as the working electrode, a platinum mesh as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The potential in all the text was referred to RHE and determined using the following equation: E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. SCE) + 0.241 + 0.0591 ℅ pH. The pH of the CO2-saturated KI solution (0.2 M) was 5.17. The synthetic process of Cu/Cu2O@NG-1 and Cu/Cu2O@NG3 was similar to the above procedure, except for the changes in the mass ratios of MOF-199 and NG (9:1, 7:3). Cu/Cu2O was also prepared with the same procedure, except that only MOF-199 was used as precursors."

A piece of the AAO membrane (used as a template) was 110 tightly stacked on the top of the Au foil and this AAO-masked Au 111 foil working electrode was sealed in a home-made electrode holder 112 (as shown in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Material) with a cer- 113 tain exposed surface area of 0.985 cm 2 . Before the electrodeposi- 114 tion of Cu x Au y NWA, a thin layer of Au was galvanostatically pre- 115 electrodeposited at the current density of ?0.5 mA cm ?2 for 20 min 116 in a solution containing 0.02 M HAuCl 4 and 0.1 M ethylenediamine 117 on a CHI440C electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, China) to fill 118 the slight gap between the Au foil and AAO membrane. The so- 119 lution for the electrodeposition of Cu x Au y NWAs contained 0.02 M 120 CuSO 4 , 0.2 M glycine, 2 mM HAuCl 4 , and 10 mM ethylenediamine 121 [25] . The pH of the deposition solution was adjusted to ‵7.3 by 122 using 5 M NaOH solution. The Cu x Au y NWAs with various atomic 123 ratios of Cu and Au (i.e., CuAu, Cu 3 Au, and CuAu 3 NWAs) were fab- 124 ricated by using a potentiostatic pulse-electrodeposition method in 125 the same deposition solution but with different deposition param- 126 eters at 25 ～C on an Autolab PGSTAT204 electrochemical worksta- 127 tion (Metrohm). Specifically, in a single cycle of the potentiostatic 128 pulse-electrodeposition of the CuAu NWA, the potential on the 129 working electrode was first set to ?0.45 V for 5 s, then the cell was 130 off for 10 s, and subsequently the potential on the working elec- 131 trode was driven to 0.001 V for 0.05 s. These three potential steps 132 were cycled for 3500 times to accomplish the electrodeposition of 133 the CuAu NWA. The Cu 3 Au and CuAu 3 NWAs were also grown by 134 using the potentiostatic pulse-electrodeposition method except for 135 that the first potential on the working electrode was set to ?0.5 136 and ?0.4 V and the number of the repeating cycles was 30 0 0 and 137 40 0 0, respectively. The Cu x Au y NWAs were fabricated by using the 138 AAO membrane as the sacrificial template, which was removed in 139 1 M NaOH solution after the electrodeposition. For comparison, the 140 Cu 3 Au film was electrodeposited in the same electrolyte at a con- 141 stant potential of ?0.5 V. 142 2.3. Physiochemical characterizations 143"

From SEM images, it was observed that nanospheres (for Cu and CuxZny), nanocubes (for Cu and CuxZny) and nanodendrites (for Cu) or nanocauliflowers (for CuxZny) were formed when the oxidation potential was changed from 0.7 V to 0.9 V, and 1.1 V, respectively. Surface roughness was increased when higher oxidation potential limits were applied to the electrodes during the oxidation-reduction treatment (nanocauliflowers~ nanodendrites > nanocubes > nanospheres). The production of C2+ compounds was showed to be influenced by the roughness factor, zinc content, and nanostructure shape. For a given shape, increasing the surface roughness factor led to higher FEs to C2+ compounds. The increase of zinc content in the polished flat electrodes showed to decrease the amount C2+ compounds produced. On the other hand, for OD-electrodes of a given shape, zinc content leads to a higher total FE for C2+. Although both roughness factor and catalyst alloy composition can impact the catalytic performance towards the production of C2+ compounds, the electrode nanostrucure shape showed to be the biggest factor in enhancing C2+ formation.

In brief, NCF/Cu electrodewas fabricated by electrochemical dealloying of thermal-treated CueZn sample in 25mMHCl using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV).With the NCF/Cu electrode as working electrode (2 cm2 exposed area), electrodeposition of nanostructured CueAu alloy was conducted under constant potential in solution containing 0.1 MH2SO4, 5mMCuSO4, and 5 mM HAuCl4. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and a platinum plate were used as reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The total deposition charge was set to 0.2 C. The as-synthesized CueAu alloy electrodes were then used as working electrode and immersed into electrolyte with 2 cm2 exposed area. The electrochemical behaviors of CueAu alloy electrodes were evaluated by LSV in a phosphate buffered solution (PBS, 0.2 M Na2SO4, 0.2 M NaH2PO4eNa2HPO4, pH 7.6) saturated with either CO2 or Ar. Bulk electro-reduction of CO2 was performed in an H-type cell separated by a cation exchangemembrane (Nafion 117). Before this electrolysis, a catholyte of 0.5 M KHCO3 solution was bubbled with Ar to remove oxygen and then saturated with ultrapure CO2 (99.999%) by bubbling for 30 min (298 K, pH 7.6). Bulk electrolysis was carried out at 1.1 V (vs. SCE) and total consumed charge was 8 C per sample. For the test of Cu or Au nanoparticles, 8 mg powder of Cu nanoparticles (20e40 nm, Alfa Aesar) or Au nanoparticles (20e25 nm, Alfa Aesar) were ultrasonically dispersed in 1 mL Nafion solution (0.5 wt%) and 0.25 mL of mixture was dropped onto a carbon cloth (2 cm2 area, Japan, NOKH2315 GDL) as nanostructured electrode. These were then dried in a vacuum-oven at 50 C for 2 h to remove residual alcohols of Nafion solution."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "In a typical synthesis, 1 mmol CuCl2﹞2H2O, 3 mmol thiourea (Tu), 2 mmol polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW = 40000), and 15 mL ethylene glycol (EG) were mixed in a three-neck flask. The mixture was heated to 150 ～C and refluxed for 30 minutes, and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The dark green precipitate was washed with distilled water and ethanol for several times. The final product was obtained after being dried at 50 ～C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. To control the product morphology and composition, the amount of Tu was reduced to 0.75 mmol or the reaction temperature was increased to 180 ～C, while other conditions were kept the same. The structure characterization and electrochemical measurement were described in the Supplementary Materials. 3. Results and Discussion As shown in Fig. 1a, CuS nanoflowers composed of nanosheets were synthesized by solvothermal method at 150 ～C in EG, with the feed ratio of Cu/S at 1:3. All the diffraction peaks in XRD pattern (Fig. 1b) can be indexed to the covellite CuS phase (PDF 06-0464). HR-TEM image shows the lattice spacing of the primary nanosheet in CuS nanoflowers was 2.8 ? (Fig. 1c), which matches the (103) plane of hexagonal covellite phase. Fig. 1d is the EDX spectra of CuS nanoflowers, demonstrating that they are comprised of Cu and S. To further identify the valence states of Cu and S, XPS analysis was performed. As shown in the Cu 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 1e), the peaks at 932.5 eV and 952.5 eV can be assigned to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, together with the absence of shake-up satellite peaks, indicate Cu exists in +1 state. The S 2p peak can be deconvoluted to S2-, S2- and high valence S complex [13], respectively, as shown in Fig. 1f. The effect of Cu/S feed ratio and reaction temperature on copper sulfide formation were then 4 investigated. When Cu/S feed ratio was lowered from 1:3 to 1:0.75, copper sulfide with triangular plate morphology was formed (Fig. 2a). XRD analysis indicates other than covellite CuS, there also exists monoclinic Cu7S4 phase (PDF 23-0958), as shown in Fig. 2b. EDX measurement reveals that the average Cu/S atomic ratio of triangular plate was 1.45 (Cu1.45S). Furthermore, reaction temperature also influences copper sulfide formation. When the reaction temperature was increased from 150 ～C to 180 ～C, the obtained products maintain nanoflower-like morphology (Fig. 2c), but XRD analysis identified the existence of orthogonal Cu7S4 (PDF 33-0489) impurity phase (Fig. 2d). EDX result shows that the average Cu/S atomic ratio is 1.54 (Cu1.54S). These results indicate that both Cu/S feed ratio and reaction temperature are important experimental parameters for synthesizing pure covellite CuS nanoflowers. CuCl2 and Tu are known to form a Cu-Tu complex [14], which acts as actual precursor for synthesizing CuS under solvothermal conditions. Therefore, the Tu/Cu feed molar ratio should be high enough in order to obtain pure CuS phase, otherwise Cu-rich phase would be formed. In addition, high reaction temperature is required to pyrolyze Cu-Tu complex into CuS. However, when the reaction temperature exceeds certain threshold, due to the reducing power of EG, the formed CuS might be further reduced to Cu-rich phases such as Cu7S4, consistent with our previous observations [15]. The electrochemical performances of copper sulfides precatalysts in the CO2 reduction reaction were evaluated in an H-type cell (Fig. 3a) using a standard three-electrode system. Taking CuS nanoflowers as an example, they were first electrochemically reduced to SD-Cu, which showed very little morphological changes (Fig. S1). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was then conducted on SD-Cu to evaluate its electrochemical activity. As shown in Fig. 3b, the current density in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 was larger than that in N2-saturated solution, suggesting SD-Cu is more 5 favorable for CO2 reduction reaction than hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Under all applied potentials (-0.6 V, -0.8 V, -1.0 V and -1.2 V vs. RHE), the current densities displayed good stability (Fig. 3c). The performance of SD-Cu was quantitatively evaluated by calculating the FEHCOOH through analyzing the liquid-phase products after 2 h of potentiostatic electrolysis. From Fig. 3d, it can be seen that the FEHCOOH of SD-Cu originating from CuS nanoflowers can reach approximately 52% at -0.8 V ~ -1.0 V. In comparison, when Cu1.54S nanoflowers and Cu1.45S nanoplates were used as precatalysts, the FEHCOOH can only reach 37.5% and 24.2% (Fig. S2), respectively. Therefore, the selectivity of HCOOH depends both on the sulfur content and morphology of copper sulfides precatalysts. During the electrochemical reduction of copper sulfides to metallic Cu, S2- ions were released into the electrolyte and absorbed on the surface of Cu catalysts, which suppressed the formation of other hydrocarbon products and resulted in the high selectivity towards HCOOH during CO2 electroreduction [16]. The high S content in copper sulfides precatalysts might lead to more S2- ions absorbed on Cu surface and thus achieve higher FEHCOOH. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments using copper foil as the working electrode, with various amounts of K2S added in the KHCO3 electrolyte. It was found that the FEHCOOH of copper gradually increased with increasing K2S concentrations (Fig. S3). This is in agreement with the results that S-rich CuS has higher FEHCOOH compared to other Cu-rich copper sulfide counterparts. 4. Conclusions In summary, copper sulfide nanocrystals have been synthesized via a simple solvothermal method in ethylene glycol, with their morphology and composition varied by tuning the Cu/S feed ratio and reaction temperature. When being applied to the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOOH, CuS nanoflowers exhibited the best FE (~ 52%) due to its high S content and specific morphology, 6 compared to their more Cu-rich counterparts. This study demonstrates copper sulfide composition and morphology are important tuning parameters for optimized HCOOH production via CO2 electrochemical reduction, which should be considered for future catalyst design.

Fig. 1A and B shows the transmission electron microcopy (TEM) image of the 7 nm (7.470.4 nm) (Fig. 1A) and 13 nm (13.170.6 nm) Cu NPs (Fig. 1B). The representative Cu NPs were further characterized by HRTEM (Fig. 1C and D). The HRTEM images show the lattice fringes with the inter-fringe distance of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of the face-centered cubic (fcc) Cu. The multiple crystal domains and the surface disordering observed from the images also indicate the as-synthesized NPs are in polycrystalline and the surface Cu may have been oxidized."

Firstly, the Pd-Cu nanoparticles were prepared under an argon atmosphere. Taking the synthesis of Pd85Cu15 nanoparticles as an example, the oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) were mixed with ethylene glycol (EG). Following this, two metal precursor solutions of Pd(CH3COO)2 in acetone and Cu(CH3COO)2?H2O in water with a molar ratio of 5:1 were added. The mixture was stirred vigorously and first heated to 120 ⊥ for 30 min. Subsequently, the temperature was raised to 200 ⊥ and kept at reflux for 90 min. The as-prepared colloidal nanoparticles dispersions were separated through extraction with hexane. The nanoparticles were re-dispersed in hexane after washing procedure with hexane and ethanol. Two kinds of Pd-Cu nanoparticles with different compositions can be obtained via adjustment of the molar ratio between palladium acetate and copper acetate. Secondly, the PdCu nanoparticles were subsequently loaded on Vulcan XC-72R carbon black (Cabot). Capping ligands on the particle surface were removed through thermal decomposition at high temperature, i.e. 350 ～C for 4 h under H2 atmosphere and then passivation with O2/N2 (5% O2) at room temperature. The carbon-supported Pd nanoparticles catalyst (Pd/C) was prepared in a similar way."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "To prepare oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu) electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, a two-step method involving the thermal oxidation and the subsequent electrochemical reduction was adopted [36,38,40,42]. Cu oxides were firstly grown on the Cu substrates by annealing in air. The subsequent reduction by cathodic polarization was performed under CO2 electrolysis conditions. For the flat Cu foil substrate, due to its low exposed geometric surface area, the growth of Cu oxides on its surface is limited and ineffective. Hence, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) for the Cu foil after the Cu oxide reduction is limited, leading to the low catalytic current for CO2 reduction. Moreover, the generated Cu oxides tend to detach from the flat substrate due to the large lattice mismatch between the underlying Cu substrate and obtained Cu oxides [44]. In the present study, a Cu foam with threedimensional (3D) Cu skeletons was selected to prepare high surface area Cu catalysts for CO2 reduction. Because of its 3D open frameworks with appropriate pore sizes, the catalytic sites are easily accessible by reactants and electrolytes. The formation of abundant active sites and distinct surface crystal structures largely enhance the catalytic current densities (normalized by the projected geometrical area), resulting in an extremely low overpotential for CO2 reduction. Such catalyst is beneficial for the electrochemical cell design aiming at low energy consumption. . (e) 500 ～C-annealed Cu foam electrode after electrochemical reduction at 0.45 V at a higher magnification. After removal of native oxide by washing with 1 M HCl(aq), the Cu oxides were generated on Cu foam surfaces by air annealing at various temperatures ranging from 120 to 500 ～C for 2 h. Fig. S1a and Fig. 1b show that the surface of Cu foam is slightly changed at 120 ～C and some small particles start to develop at 200 ～C. When the temperature is increased to 300 and 400 ～C (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1b), the Cu foam surface becomes much rougher, indicating an appreciable change of the surface structures. The SEM images in Fig. 1d and Fig. S1c show that large numbers of flakes ( 5 mm-thick) were formed after annealing at 500 ～C. Interestingly, the surface morphologies remain the same even after electrochemical reduction as shown in Fig. 1e. It is also noted that reduction of Cu oxides was performed in the set-up and conditions for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 (i.e. in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution at the potential of 0.45 V vs. RHE)."

The morphology of CuSn NWs was performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is obvious that the product consists of 1D nanostructure with high uniformity (Figure 1a). Interestingly, there is an amorphous shell surround the surface of NWs, as revealed by the enlarged TEM image (Figure 1b). The diameter of CuSn NWs was measured to be 21.8 ㊣ 2.9 nm, larger than that of Cu NWs (17.1 ㊣ 2.7 nm) (Figure S1-2). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image reveal that the clear lattice spacing of 0.209 nm was belong to the (111) plane of Cu and the amorphous shell with thickness of around 2.0 nm were observed (Figure 1c). The overall Cu/Sn composition was about 4:1 and determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) (Figure 1d). Power X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was used to analyze the phase change and structure evolution (Figure 1e), where the positions of main diffraction peaks were located at 43.3 o , 50.4 o and 74.1 o , corresponding to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of metallic Cu (PDF#04-0836), respectively. No significant diffraction peaks for Sn species can be observed, further proving that Sn species in CuSn NWs is amorphous. The valence state and electron structure of Sn species were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), two peaks with the binding energies (BEs) of 495.2 eV (3d3/2) and 486.9 eV (3d5/2) can be assigned to Sn 4+ , respectively, showing that the amorphous Sn species in CuSn NWs is of SnO2 (Figure 1f).[29,30] The elemental distribution of CuSn NWs was confirmed by scanning TEM-EDS (STEM-EDS) element mappings (Figure 1g), where Sn is rich surround the NWs and Cu is limited in the inner region, demonstrating that the CuSn NWs have core-shell structures."

Ag and Cu remain fully phase-segregated in the as deposited bimetallic foam exhibiting a high degree of dispersion of pure nm-sized Ag domains embedded in the Cu matrix. An activation of this bimetallic material towards ethanol formation is achieved by thermal annealing of the as deposited foam under mild conditions (200～ C for 12 h). Such annealing quantitatively transforms the Cu in the bimetallic system into a mixture of crystalline Cu2O and amorphous CuO whereas the Ag remains in its metallic state due to the thermal instability of Ag2O above temperatures of 180～ C. The selective oxidation of Cu in the bimetallic Ag15Cu85 catalyst goes along with an enrichment of Cu oxides on the surface of the formed mixed AgCu xO foam. Both operando X-ray diffraction and operando Raman spectroscopy demonstrate, however, that the oxide reduction is completed before the electrochemical CO2 reduction sets in. The thus formed oxide-derived (OD) bimetallic Ag15Cu85 foam catalyst shows high selectivity towards alcohol formation with Faradaic efficiencies of FEEtOH = 33.7% and FEn-PrOH = 6.9% at -1.0 V and -0.9 V vs RHE, respectively. Extended electrolysis experiments (100 h) indicate a superior degradation resistance of the oxide-derived bimetallic catalyst which is ascribed to the effective suppression of the C1 hydrocarbon reaction pathway thus avoiding irreversible carbon contaminations appearing in particular during methane production."

Next, CuO NWs were potentiostatically reduced to Cu by applying -1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in a 0.5 M NaOH (98%, Daejung). At last, Ag galvanic displacement was conducted to deposit Ag on Cu NWs.

Polycrystalline Cu foils (Alfa Aesar; 0.1 mm thick, Puratronic, 99.999% metals basis) were first rinsed with Milli-Q water, dried with nitrogen, and then electrochemically polished in phosphoric acid (85% in water) by applying +2.1 V versus a graphite rod for 5 min. For the synthesis of the Cu3N layer, the pre-cleaned Cu foil was loaded into a horizontal quartz tube reactor and heated by a two-zone Mellen furnace equipped with clamshell heating elements. Quartz tube and gas lines were carefully evacuated prior to the introduction of the reactive gases. The Cu foil was then annealed at 550 ～C in an NH3/O2 mixture for a period of 15 to 60 min at atmospheric pressure. The flows of NH3 and O2 were introduced through calibrated mass flow controllers in order to achieve a total flow rate of 75 sccm, with a nominal concentration of 2 vol% O2. The annealed Cu foils were slowly cooled down to room temperature under the same gas environment before they were taken out of the reactor. Physical characterization. In-situ XRD diffraction patterns were obtained using a Rigaku Smartlab X-ray diffractometer equipped with a ReactorX attachment; a corrosion resistant hightemperature reactor, and a HyPix-3000 high-energy-resolution 2D multidimensional semiconductor detector. The incident X-ray beam was filtered using a double-crystal highresolution PB-Ge (220)x2 monochromator. The surface morphology was visualized using SEM (Quanta FEG 250, FEI).

The surface compositions were investigated using XPS acquired by a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer using an Al K汐 source (h糸 = 1486.69 eV) operated at 225 W and a hemispherical electron energy analyzer. XPS binding energies were calibrated using adventitious alkyl carbon signals by shifting the C 1s peak to 284.8 eV. The XAS data were acquired at beamline 9-3 (BL9-3) at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The SPEAR3 storage ring operated at 500 mA and 3.0 GeV. BL9-3 is equipped with a rhodium-coated vertical collimating mirror upstream of the Si(220) monochromator and an additional downstream rhodium-coated bent-cylindrical focusing mirror. Harmonic rejection was accomplished by setting the cut-off angle of the mirrors to an appropriate energy. Incident and transmitted X-rays were monitored using gas ionization chambers and X-ray absorption was measured as the primary fluorescence excitation spectrum using an array of 100- element Ge detector. Electrochemical measurements. All electrochemical experiments were conducted in a gas-tight electrochemical cell machined from polyether ether ketone (PEEK).[27] A graphite rod (99.995%, Sigma Aldrich) was used as the counter electrode, placed parallel to the working electrode and separated by an anion conducting membrane (Selemion AMV AGC Inc.). Gas dispersion frits were incorporated into both electrode chambers to provide ample electrolyte mixing. The exposed geometric surface area of each electrode was 1 cm2 and the electrolyte volume of each electrode chamber was 1.8 cm3. A leak-free Ag/AgCl electrode (Innovative Instruments Inc.) was used as the reference electrode, all potentials were measured against Ag/AgCl and then converted to the RHE scale using the relationship E (vs RHE) = E (vs Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 V + 0.0591℅pH, where pH values of electrolytes were determined by an Orion Dual Star Benchtop Meter (Thermo Scientific). A 0.05 M M2CO3 (99.995%, Sigma Aldrich) solution prepared using Milli-Q water was used as the electrolyte. Metallic impurities in the as-prepared electrolyte were removed before electrolysis by chelating the solution with Chelex 100 (Na form, Sigma Aldrich). Both electrode chambers were sparged with CO2 (99.999%, Praxair Inc.) at a rate of 20 sccm for 40 min prior to and throughout CO2 electrolysis. Prior to CO2RR measurements, a pre-reduction step was carried out for 90 min chronoamperometry at -0.6 V in CO2-saturated 0.1 M CsHCO3. Electrochemistry was performed with a Biologic VSP-300 potentiostat. Potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) and current interrupt (CI) methods were used to determine the uncompensated resistance (Ru) of the electrochemical cell. The potentiostat compensated for 85% of Ru in situ.

CO2RR products quantification. The effluent from the electrochemical cell was analyzed using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a pulsed-discharge helium ionization detector (PDHID). He (99.9999%, Praxair Inc.) was used as the carrier gas. The constituents of the gaseous sample were separated using a Hayesep-Q capillary column (Agilent) connected in series with a packed ShinCarbon ST column (Restek Co.). The signal response of the PDHID was calibrated by analyzing a series of NIST-traceable standard gas mixtures (Airgas Inc.). The partial current density for a given gas product was calculated as ?? = ?? ℅ ? ℅ ????0 ?? ℅ (????????? ????) 求1 , where is the volume fraction of certain product determined by online GC, is the flow rate, ?? ? ?? is the number of electrons required to form product i, = 101.3 kPa, F is the Faradaic constant ?0 and R is the gas constant.

The electrolyte from cathodic chamber was collected after ?? = ?? ?????? ℅ 100 % electrolysis and analyzed using a Thermo Scientific UltiMate 3000 liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a refractive index detector (RID). The electrolyte samples were stored in a refrigerated autosampler at 10 ～C before analysis to minimize the evaporation of volatile products. The liquid-phase products contained in a 20 米L aliquot were separated using two Aminex HPX 87-H columns (Bio-Rad Inc.) connected in series and a 1 mM sulfuric acid eluent (99.999%, Sigma Aldrich). The column oven was maintained at 60 ～C for the duration of the analysis. The signal response of the RID was calibrated by analyzing standard solutions of each product at a concentration of 1, 10, and 50 mM."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Cu3N was prepared by thermal annealing of an electropolished Cu foil at atmospheric pressure in a NH3/O2 mixture for 15 to 60 min at a temperature of 550～C which resulted in formation of a film of Cu3N on the surface of the Cu foil. The growth of Cu3N proceeds from top to bottom. It starts with the formation of a surface copper oxide that serves to activate the dehydrogenation of NH3 producing water and copper nitride.26, 27,28, 29 After thermal nitriding, the resulting film has a green color and is confirmed by XRD to be Cu3N, which has an anti-ReO3 (anti-perovskite) cubic structure built up of eight corner-sharing NCu6 octahedra (Figure 1A). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 7 The relatively smooth surface of the electropolished Cu foil was significantly roughened as a result of the formation of Cu3N, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 1B and 1C). This can be attributed to the crystallographic transformation of the Cu crystal lattice to accommodate the nitrogen atoms.30 The Cu molar density is 0.141 and 0.09 mol cm-3 for Cu and Cu3N, respectively. As such, a volumetric expansion of the Cu atomic density by a factor of 1.6 is necessary to accommodate the inclusion of the N atoms into the crystal. Considering the process temperature is well below the melting point of either material, the resulting film is significantly roughening by the transformation from Cu to Cu3N. The degree of surface roughness was controlled by adjusting the nitriding time (Supporting Information, Figure S1); increasing the nitriding time increased the surface roughness. To gain further insight into the mechanism of Cu3N formation, the evolution of crystalline phase was monitored as a function of time and temperature by in-situ out-of-plane XRD using a temperature-controlled reactor (ReactorX, Rigaku-Smartlab). This leak-tight reactor enables realtime XRD measurements while keeping the sample at well-controlled temperature and in a wellcontrolled atmosphere. To reproduce the same conditions as those in the nitridation furnace, the same flow rates of NH3 and O2 but diluted by Ar (to reduce the NH3 concentration to acceptable levels for the ReactorX) were fed to the XRD reactor through calibrated mass flow controllers. The Cu foil was heated to and maintained at 550～C for 1 h, after which it was slowly cooled down to room temperature under the same gas composition (Supporting Information, Figure S2). As shown in Figure 1D, the formation of Cu3N begins during heating at 400～C and is characterized by the appearance of diffraction peaks centered at 23.27～ and 47.18～. These features are assigned to the (100) and (200) crystallographic planes of Cu3N, respectively. The Cu3N formed exhibits a preferential orientation around (100)-planes with weak contributions from (111) and (210). The underlying Cu crystal exhibits a temperature-dependent lattice constant due to thermal expansion (Supporting Information, Figure S3).30 The crystalline quality of the Cu3N was found to depend critically on the cooling rate. Rapid cooling led to poor Cu3N crystallinity. These observations indicate that Cu3N can be grown by activating NH3 at a temperature as low as 400～C, a temperature that is much lower than that reported for similar growth techniques using nitrogen-based gas phase precursors.27, 31 The mechanism of Cu3N formation and growth by this technique will be discussed in a separate study. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59"

This feature is consistent with the Cu每Bi phase diagram obtained at room temperature.

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Synthesis and Characterization of Single Crystal Cu(111) Foils. Single crystalline Cu(111) foils (hereafter abbreviated as Cu(111)) were fabricated by annealing polycrystalline copper (abbreviated as p-Cu) at high temperature in a mixed Ar/H2 gas flow, as detailed in the Experimental Section in Supporting Information. The obtained Cu(111) foil shows a uniform and monotonous color after surface oxidation at 200 ～C in air (Figure S1), affirming the single crystallinity of the Cu foil with monofacet exposure.41,42 XRD taken on the Cu(111) foil displays only one family of lattice planes belonging to {111} (Figure 1a), whereas that of the p-Cu presents multiple peaks, including the low-index facets of (111), (100), (110) and the high-index facets such as (331) and (311), etc. (Figure 1g). Both SEM and high-resolution AFM images in Figure 1b and Figure 1c, respectively, show a flat surface morphology of Cu(111) lack of grain boundaries, exhibiting slip lines of ‵60～ in cross angles that are typically seen for metal (111) surfaces.43 In comparison, p-Cu exhibits a much rougher surface composed of numerous grooves originating from the manufacturing process (Figure 1h,i), indicative of large crystalline and morphological heterogeneity. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was further employed to verify the crystalline unity and heterogeneity for the Cu(111) and p-Cu foils, respectively.42,43 As shown in Figure 1d, the inverse pole figure (IPF) color map in normal direction displays a uniform blue color, attesting to the single crystalline (111) facet exposure and homogeneous in-plane crystalline orientation, which is further confirmed by the even distribution of projection points in the (111) pole figure (Figure 1e). The kernel average misorientation (KAM) map on Cu(111) displays a small angular variation less than 1～, further corroborating the high uniformity of surface facet orientation (Figure 1f). On the contrary, EBSD characterizations on the p-Cu foil are drastically different. Whereas the IPF map reveals a heterogeneous arrangement of exposed facets and grain boundaries (Figure 1j), the corresponding pole figure in Figure 1k exhibits no regular distribution pattern of projection points. The KAM map displays a larger misorientation of ‵3～ (Figure 1l), further affirming its polycrystalline nature. Collectively, the EBSD characterizations above strongly attest to the successful transformation from the original polycrystalline Cu foil into a single-crystalline entity of Cu(111) upon annealing. CO2R on Pristine and Slightly Oxidized Polycrystalline and Single-Crystal Cu Foils. First of all, electrochemical CO2R tests were carried out in H-cell (Figure S2) to assess the pristine pCu and Cu(111) foils with respect to their intrinsic catalytic behavior. In order to minimize surface oxidation, the Cu(111) foils were tested immediately upon being taken out from the Ar/H2 filled CVD tube, while the p-Cu samples were reduced in H2 at 350 ～C for 2 h before testing. At this annealing condition, p-Cu exhibited the same surface roughness and polycrystallinity except that the intensities of {100} peaks are comparatively intensified (Figure S3). In both cases, H2 composed the majority of the reduction products together with only a small fraction of CO (Figure S4). Specifically, on pCu, the highest Faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO was 9.2 ㊣ 0.9% at ?1.2 VRHE and the largest CO partial current density was only 0.11 ㊣ 0.03 mA cm?2 at ?1.3 VRHE. On Cu(111), the highest CO FE was 4.7 ㊣ 0.6% observed at ?1.2 VRHE, while the CO partial current density increased with the increasing bias but still only attained 0.1 mA cm?2 at ?1.8 VRHE. In the current study, we did not analyze the liquid products due to the facts that the majority of reduction products are gases and the overall low Faradaic current of the tests would require a long time to collect any meaningful amount for accurate analyses. Nonetheless, the observations made here suggest that despite the possession of grain boundaries and high-index facets, the thermally annealed p-Cu manifests very limited improvement in catalyzing CO2R when compared to the single crystal Cu(111). Of note, the unusually low FEs and current densities of CO production observed here might be attributed to a few material and instrumental facts, including the following: (1) the reconstructed surface obtained by thermally annealing in H2 is thermodynamically more pristine, with lack of adequate active motifs;22 (2) the flat Cu foils with minimal surface area and porosity disfavor the triphasic CO2R reaction involving gas reactant, as previous studies have shown the increase in local roughness and porosity helps enrich CO2 concentration and increase local pH in the Helmholtz layer, thus promoting the CO2 conversion; 44,45 (3) compared to the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) loaded with nanocrystalline Cu catalysts, the intrinsically lower CO2 coverage on the copper foil electrode in the H-cell significantly dampens the kinetics of CO2R. Thus, the experimental setup engaging Cu foil in H-cell is better suited for mechanistic understanding rather than performance benchmarking. Interestingly, after the exposure to ambient air for just 1 day, both the p-Cu and Cu(111) foils showed notably improved CO2R performance. Although CO and H2 were still the only detected gaseous reduction products, both the FE and partial current density of CO are much larger. As shown in Figure S5, on p-Cu-1d (abbreviation for the polycrystalline Cu exposed in air for 1 day) the CO FE increased to 24.8 ㊣ 6.9% at ?1.4 VRHE, concomitant with a maximal partial current density of 0.4 ㊣ 0.1% mA cm?2. Similar to the scenario of the pristine Cu(111), the CO partial current density of Cu(111)-1d increased with increasing applied negative bias, reaching 0.4 ㊣ 0.2% mA cm?2 at ?1.8 VRHE. Meanwhile, the maximal CO FE https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c00588 J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 3941?3950 was 15.2 ㊣ 5.5% observed at ?1.2 VRHE. The improved CO2R performance on both p-Cu-1d and Cu(111)-1d can be certainly attributed to their slightly oxidized surfaces, since no other modifications to the samples were made. As shown in Figure S6a,b, despite no signals of copper oxides were detectable from XRD taken on the Cu(111)-1d sample, two weak satellite peaks can be visualized from the XPS Cu 2p spectrum, indicating the existence of Cu+ species.33 As the Cu 2p binding energies between Cu0 and Cu+ differ by only 0.1 eV, it would be almost impossible to decouple them through"

The Cu mesh was cleaned in 1 mol/L HCl by sonication for 1 min to remove the native oxide layer. It was then rinsed with DI water several times. After drying in N2, the Cu mesh was immediately put in a muffle furnace and annealed in air at 600 ～C for 4 h to grow CuOx NAs. 30 2.2.2. Synthesis of OD-Cu NAs. The Cu NAs were synthesized by a two-step method including thermal reduction and electrochemical reduction. First, nonfully reduced CuOx NAs were obtained by annealing the CuOx NAs in forming gas (5% H2/N2, 50 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm)) at 300 ～C for approximately 5, 10, and 15 min, respectively. To be noted, fully reduced Cu NAs could be obtained by annealing the CuOx NAs at 300 ～C for approximately 45 min in the forming gas. Then, electrochemical reduction at ?0.3 V (vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) was used to convert the nonfully reduced CuOx NAs to OD-Cu NAs in N2 purged 0.1 mol/L KHCO3 electrolyte. The electrochemical reduction was monitored by recording the cathodic current. The sign for the complete reduction was that the current reached a near-zero steady state (Figure S1). The total charge passed during the reduction process was recorded as an indication for different types of nonfully reduced CuOx NAs. Thus, the nonfully reduced CuOx NAs in this study could be denoted by a unit: C/cm2 (charge per electrode area). The obtained OD-Cu NAs were used as catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction. 2.3. Material Characterizations. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed using an FEI Quanta FEG 250 microscope operated at 30 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu K汐 source (竹 = 1.5406 ?). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out with a PHI VersaProbe II spectrometer. All XPS spectra were calibrated to their corresponding C 1 s (284.8 eV). The Cu mesh sample was measured after the HCl acid cleaning treatment to remove the surface oxides. 2.4. Electrochemical Measurements. The electrochemical reduction of CO2 was conducted using a CHI workstation (CHI760E, CH Instruments) and a gas-tight closed, two-compartment electrochemical cell (H-type cell) (Figure S2). All the applied potentials were reported vs RHE potentials according to eq 1: = + + ℅E E(vs RHE) (vs Ag/AgCl) 0.199 V 0.0591 V pH (1)"

The Cu foil substrate was first electropolished in 50% orthophosphoric acid (ACS grade, SigmaAldrich) to remove contamination and the native oxide layer from its surface. For this purpose, a two-electrode arrangement was used, with graphite and Cu foil serving as a cathode and anode, respectively. For the electropolishing treatment, a potential difference of 2 V was applied for ‵2 min. The Cu foil was then thoroughly rinsed with Milli-Q water, sonicated for 15 min in absolute ethanol (Merck, Germany), and finally dried in air before using it as the support for the foam electrodeposition. Before electrodeposition, the Cu support was masked with insulating PTFE tape, defining a geometrical surface area (Ageo) of 1 cm 2. The In55Cu45 alloy electrodeposition was carried out from a 1.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte (pH ＞ 0.5) containing 20 mM indium sulfate and 5 mM copper sulfate precursor salts (25 mM total metal ion concentration).

A 128N potentiostat/ galvanostat (Metrohm Autolab) was used for all electrochemical measurements. Cell resistance was measured by means of impedance spectroscopy before each CO2 electrolysis experiment. A custommade H-type glass cell was used for the CO2RR experiments, where the cathode and anode compartments were separated by a proton exchange Nafion membrane (Nafion 117, Electrochem, USA).

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Based on the above works, a key question remains unanswered: how is the selective reduction of CO2 to formate (HCOO?) on the CuSx promoted? Herein, by comparing the CO2 catalytic performances of active CuSx (AC-CuSx), desulfurized CuSx (DS-CuSx), and bare Cu catalysts, we show that the presence of sulfur is crucial. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further demonstrate that sulfur＊s effect on the binding strengths of HCOO* and *COOH adsorbates is responsible for the selectivity toward formate. 2.1. Catalyst Preparation. All samples were prepared on Cu disc substrates (10 mm diameter, 99.99%, Goodfellow). The Cu disk surfaces were dominated by (111) phases (Section S1, Supporting Information). A three-electrode setup was used for catalyst electrodeposition. A platinum wire and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl, Pine) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Unless specifically stated, a Gamry 600 potentiostat was used for all electrochemical measurements. 2.1.1. Bare Cu. The Cu disks were mechanically polished using diamond slurries (DiaPro 15 and 3 米m, Struers). They were then sonicated and rinsed with water. 2.1.2. Fresh CuSx. CuSx films were electrochemically deposited onto the polished Cu disks using square wave voltammetry (2000 cycles), with a ※forward§ potential of ?0.54 V versus RHE for 10 ms and a ※reverse§ potential of 0.21 V for 20 ms (unless specifically stated, all potentials hereafter are referenced to the RHE).19 The plating solution contained 4 mM CuSO4﹞5H2O (98.5?101%,GCE), 4 mM thiourea (≡99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.648 M HCl (37%, RCI Labscan). 2.1.3. Active CuSx (AC-CuSx). The fresh CuSx samples were reduced in 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte (99.7%, Merck) at ?0.85 V for 5 min before their use as catalysts for CO2 reduction in fresh electrolytes. 2.1.4. Desulfurized CuSx (DS-CuSx). Desulfurized CuSx was prepared by reducing a freshly prepared CuSx catalyst at ?1000 mA/cm2 for 30 min in 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte (Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT30). The 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte was replaced every 10 min with a fresh solution. 2.2. Materials Characterization. The physical and elemental compositions of the catalysts were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Panalytical X＊Pert PRO high-resolution XRD and Bruker D8 Advance), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6701F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive Xray (EDX) spectroscopy (JEOL JEM-3011). TEM samples were prepared by removing the catalyst films from the substrates and dispersing them in ethanol. The suspensions were then drop-casted onto TEM grids (LC325-Ni, 300 mesh, Electron Microscopy Sciences). The electronic structures of the samples were examined"

The samples were then thoroughly rinsed in Milli-Q water and sonicated for 15 mins in high purity ethanol (VWR Reag., France). They were subsequently masked by Teflon tape leaving an exposed area of 1 cm2. The substrates were then used as working electrodes for the DHBT-assisted galvanostatic deposition (e.g., at constant current density j = - 3 A cm-2 for 20 s) of three main classes of samples, namely pure-Zn, pure-Cu and Zn-Cu alloys. In all three cases (and for all subsequent electrochemical experiments) a potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm Autolab 128N, The Netherlands) was used in a three electrode cell arrangement. A double junction Ag/AgCl3M electrode (Metrohm, Switzerland) was employed as reference electrode and bare Cu and Zn foils acted as counter electrodes for pure-Cu and Zn-Cu alloys and pure-Zn samples, respectively. The supporting electrolyte was in all cases 1.5 M H2SO4 (Selectipur, BASF SE, Ludwigshafen Germany) and the metal ion source was 0.2 M ZnSO4 (ReagentPlus, SigmaAldrich) and 0.2 M CuSO4 (Honeywell Fluka Puriss, Germany) for Zn and Cu samples, respectively. In case of Zn-Cu alloy samples, eight different plating bath compositions were used, which are summarized in Table S1 of the Supplementary Information (SI) section. Potential transients and optical micrographs of the surface samples during metal deposition were taken that show the simultaneous generation of hydrogen bubbles at the sample- electrolyte interface (see Figs. S1-2). The samples were thoroughly rinsed by Milli-Q water after deposition, dried in a gentle Ar flux and stored for a few hours before starting the CO2RR experiments. The electrochemical surface area (denoted hereafter ECSA) of pure-Zn and optimized Zn94Cu6 alloy (see Table S1) samples was determined by comparison of their capacitance values with that of reference flat Zn and Cu foils (99.9%, and 99.95 %, Goodfellow). For this, cyclic voltammetry for selected electrodes in 0.1 M KCl at various scan rates was conducted (see Fig. S3). The accessible potential window in the case of Zn samples ranged from 每1.275 to 每1.075 V vs RHE where no redox peak appears. For the copper foil the applied potential range was -0.80 to -0.50 V vs RHE. The current densities were calculated on the basis of roughness factors derived from double layer charge/discharge curves at the middle applied potential."

As reported elsewhere,32 porous structures with dendritic walls were obtained as shown in Figure 1 (a, b). During the electrodeposition the generated hydrogen bubbles act as dynamic negative templates directing the porous structures, whereas the fine dendritic morphology of the metal film is determined by the nucleation and growth of the metal. Dendritic-like growth is observed for Cu deposits presumably at the diffusion limited regime.34-35 AgCu foams were electrodeposited using two different concentrations of the AgNO3 in the electrolyte bath, namely 10 mM (AgCu-10) and 50 mM (AgCu-50), keeping the concentration of Cu identical. Upon introduction of the second metal a change in the morphology with respect to the electrodeposited Cu foam was observed as shown in Figure 1. Increasing the concentration of AgNO3 from AgCu-10 to AgCu-50 also takes an influence on the porous structure. The dendrites present in the walls of the pores are shorter and smoothened down for AgCu compared to the Cu only deposit. We observe that on AgCu individual dendrites grow in a two dimensional pattern with reduced branching, while the dendrites of Cu foam are results of three dimensional growth. The macropores formed by the Ag deposit (Figure 1c) are significantly smaller than the Cu and AgCu macropores. The sidewalls of the macropores contain randomly ordered needle like structures in contrast to dendritic structures observed on Cu and AgCu catalysts. One could anticipate high surface area for the porous structure of the electrodeposited catalysts from the SEM images. Roughness factors of the foam catalysts were estimated from the double layer capacitance in the non-faradaic regions of the CVs as detailed in the supporting information (Figure S1, Table S1). Higher roughness factors are obtained for electrodeposited catalysts compared to bulk metal foil catalysts (Cu and Ag). Roughness of the deposited catalysts follows the order Ag < Cu < AgCu-10 < AgCu-50 (Table S1). Even though these roughness factors"

The uniform planar morphology served as a platform to evaluate the electronic effect isolated from morphological effects while minimizing geometric contributions. The catalytic selectivity and activity of Au-Cu alloys was found to be correlated with the variation of electronic structure that was varied with tunable composition. Notably, the d-band center gradually shifted away from the Fermi level with increasing the Au atomic ratio, leading to a weakened binding energy of *CO, which is consistent with low CO coverage observed in CO stripping experiments. The decrease of the *CO binding strength results in the enhanced catalytic activity for CO formation with the increase of Au content. In addition, it was observed that copper oxide/hydroxide species are less stable on Au-Cu surfaces compared to those on pure Cu surface, where the surface oxophilicity could be critical to tuning the binding strength of *OCHO. These results imply that the altered electronic structure could explain the decreased formation of HCOO岸 on the Au-Cu alloys. In general, the formation of CO and HCOO岸 as main CO2 reduction products on planar Au-Cu alloys followed the shift of d-band center, which indicates the electronic effect is the major governing factor for the electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction on Au-Cu bimetallic thin films."

XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX avoid adding reactive molecules to electrolytes or electrocatalysts. Tin (Sn) effectively catalyzes the CO2RR to produce formic acid (HCOOH) as the main product, with a faradaic efficiency (FE) greater than 90% and inhibition of the HER.20?22 There are several reports of Cu?Sn alloys developed as effective catalysts for the production of HCOOH or carbon monoxide (CO).23?31 For example, Cui et al. codeposited CuxSny alloys and found that the CuSn3 sample demonstrated better than 95% selectivity toward HCOOH at a low potential [?0.5 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)].25 Haruyama et al. electrodeposited Cu?Sn alloys with different crystal structures and found that Cu87Sn13 exhibited high selectivity toward CO (60% FE at ?0.99 V vs RHE), whereas Cu55Sn45 exhibited 60% FE for HCOOH.26 Most of the studies on Cu?Sn catalysts focused on bimetallic alloys with different composition ratios (i.e., Cu3Sn, CuSn, and CuSn3), 25,26,31 or control of the morphology by hybridizing Cu catalysts with Sn atoms.24,27,28 In these reports, the Sn content was greater than 10%; thus, the Cu terrace sites, which are active toward hydrocarbon production, were somewhat hindered by Sn atoms. As a result, hydrocarbon production was nearly suppressed. Because the atomic radius of Sn is substantially larger than that of Cu, the low-coordinated sites would be preferentially occupied by the Sn atoms in Cu?Sn catalysts. Therefore, Cu atoms with unsaturated coordination are expected to be selectively replaced when Sn is present at trace levels. On the basis of the aforementioned hypothesis, in the present work, we modified Cu nanoparticles with a trace amount of Sn atoms and used them as selective CO2RR catalysts working on gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs; Scheme 1). We investigated the preferred site of the Sn atoms and the CO2RR mechanism using first-principles calculations. ← EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Chemicals and Materials for Experiments. Copper(II) acetate monohydrate [Cu(CH3COO)2﹞H2O, 99%], tin(II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl2﹞2H2O), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 99%), methanol (CH3OH, 99.8%), potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3, 99.8%), and potassium chloride (KCl, 99.8%) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 99%) and Nafion solution (5 wt %) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All chemicals were used without further purification. Carbon paper with a gas-diffusion layer (Sigracet 38BC) and Nafion membranes (Nafion 117) were purchased from SGL Carbon and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. Ultrapure water obtained from a Milli-Q system (18.2 M次 cm) was used for all catalyst preparations and electrochemical tests. Catalyst Preparation. Sn-decorated Cu nanoparticles (Cu/Sn) were fabricated via a previously reported wet-chemical reduction method in which NaBH4 was used as the reductant. 32 Typically, Cu(CH3COO)2﹞H2O and SnCl2﹞2H2O were added to a conical flask with the desired elemental ratio and then dissolved in 250 mL of deionized water; the resultant solution was stirred for 30 min under a continuous flow of argon to remove residual O2. The total amount of metal ions was controlled to 3 mM. NaBH4 (1.14 g) dissolved into 20 mL of ultrapure water was then added to the Cu/Sn solution. The obtained black precipitate was washed with ultrapure water and C2H5OH via vacuum filtration. Finally, the prepared samples were dried at 60 ～C in a vacuum oven overnight. Pure Cu or Sn samples were synthesized in a similar manner using only the Cu or Sn precursor as the starting material. The physically mixed samples were prepared by hand-mixing in a mortar the pure Cu and Sn powders that were synthesized by the above-mentioned method in the desired ratio."

HPLC-grade solvents were used in all experiments. N,NDimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol were purchased from VWR Chemicals, while dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ≡99.9%), cyclohexane, and 2-propanol were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. 4.2. Preparation of Working Electrodes. Carbon papers (FuelCellStore, Toray 060) were used as working electrodes after cleaning with water and acetone by sonication. CuO NPs were dispersed in DMF (5 mg mL?1) by sonication for 15 min. A volume of 50 米L of the resulting dispersion was drop-casted on each side (1 ℅ 1 cm2) of a carbon paper and thoroughly dried in a fume hood. The resulting CuO-coated working electrode had a CuO loading of 0.25 mg cm?2. CuO?PVDF working electrodes were prepared by drop casting 50 米L of PVDF/DMF (5 mg mL?1) solution onto the previously prepared CuO electrodes (polymer loading = 0.25 mg cm?2). Other CuO?polymer working electrodes were prepared in the same way as CuO?PVDF, except that different solvents were used to dissolve the individual polymers [cyclohexane for PE, 2-propanol for PVP, and water/methanol (v/v = 2:3) for PVA]. In the cases of PVP and PVA, an additional 50 米L of Nafion solution (10 米L of commercial Nafion solution in 1 mL of 2-propanol) was drop-casted onto each side of the working electrode to avoid leaching of the two polymers during electrolysis. The neat Nafion loading was 0.023 mg cm?2, accounting for ‵10% of the loading of CuO and the polymer. 4.3. Characterization. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra-DLD instrument operated with a monochromatic Al K汐 X-ray source at a power of 150 W. The pressure in the main chamber during the analysis was kept around 10?11 bar. High-resolution spectra of Cu 2p and Cu LMM were recorded with a 20 eV pass energy and from the accumulation of four sweeps. CasaXPS software was used for fitting and C 1s at 285.0 eV for binding energy calibration. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed with a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer using monochromatic Cu K汐1 radiation (竹 = 1.54056 ?). The data were collected in the 2牟 window of 30? 80～. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired on an FEI Nova NanoSEM 600 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on an FEI Talos F200X analytical STEM with an XFEG at 200 kV. To have better imaging of CuO NPs in the CuO?PVDF electrodes, the PVDF layer was removed by washing the CuO?PVDF electrode with 10 mL of DMF three times before characterization. The water contact angle was measured by the sessile drop method using an FTA1000 contact angle system (First Ten Angstroms, Inc.) at room temperature. The volume of the water droplets was 2.0 米L. 4.4. Cyclic Voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetric experiments were carried out using a CHI601D potentiostat connected to a three-electrode setup. The working electrode was a carbon paper coated with the CuO or polymer-modified CuO electrocatalyst using a platinum mesh as a counter electrode along with a leak-free Ag/AgCl reference electrode (ElectroCell LF-1). The potential measured against Ag/AgCl was converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.0c03766 ACS Catal. 2021, 11, 958?966 using the formula E (vs RHE) = E (vs Ag/AgCl) + 0.21 V + RT/F ℅ ln10 ℅ pH = E (vs Ag/AgCl) + 0.63 V. The supporting electrolyte was 0.5 M KHCO3 of pH 7.3 when saturated with CO2. 4.5. ECSA Measurement. The values of ECSA were determined by chronoamperometry using K3Fe(CN)6 as a redox probe (Figure S6b). The chronoamperometric response was recorded for 1 s (with an interval of 0.001 s) after stepping the potential from 1.0 V to 0.5 V vs RHE in argon-purged 0.1 M KCl. The applied potential of 0.5 V vs RHE was set to be ‵300 mV more negative than the peak potential (‵0.80 V vs RHE; Figure S6a) to ensure that the reduction of K3Fe(CN)6 would be in the diffusion-limited regime. The ECSA values were calculated from the Cottrell equation65"

The fabrication of Cu films was performed in accordance with previous studies.29,44 The Si ATR hemispherical prism prepared for the SEIRAS measurements (0.98 inch diameter, manufactured by Pier Optics Co., Ltd.) was polished with 0.05 https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.0c04106 ACS Catal. 2020, 10, 15238?15249 mm耳 alumina for about 10 min and then washed in Milli-Q water using an ultrasonicator for 30 min. The surface of the Si prism was etched with a 40% NH4F solution, washed with Milli-Q water, and continuously plated with 0.25 M HCHO, 0.02 M CuSO4, 20 mM Na2EDTA, and 0.3 mM 2,2-bipyridine; T = 75?80 ～C for 1.0 min. After the deposition, the resistance of the film surface was measured to be 10?30 ohms. The resulting Cu films were washed with Milli-Q water, assembled into an electrolysis cell, and blanketed with 0.1 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution saturated with Ar. The films were then washed by performing 15 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV from ?0.13 to ?0.7 V vs Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 0.05 Vs?1). MT?Cu films for SEIRAS measurements were prepared using the plated Cu film as the substrate. The modification of methanethiol onto the Cu film was performed according to the same procedure used to prepare the MT?Cu electrode for CPE. After the modification, the MT?Cu film was cleaned by performing 15 cycles of CV in the same potential range used in the cleaning step. Electrochemistry. Electrochemical measurements were performed using a BAS ALS model 660E analyzer. CV was performed using one of the Cu electrodes as the working electrode, carbon paper as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) as the reference electrode. The reference electrode was formed of two layers of glass tube to prevent contamination of Ag against electrolyte or other electrodes. A 0.1 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution was prepared as the electrolyte. CPE of CO2 Using Cu Electrodes. The reduction reaction was performed using Milli-Q water containing 0.1 M NaHCO3. Carbon paper and Cu, MT?Cu, or S?Cu plate were used as the counter and working electrodes, respectively. The potentials of the working electrode were ? 1.2, ?1.4, ?1.6, and ? 1.8 V vs Ag/AgCl, and the reaction time was 1.0 h. Analysis of the products of electrolysis showed that formate was detected by ion chromatography, ethanol was inferred by GC (Shimadzu GC-2014), and other gaseous products were detected by GC (Agilent Technologies 7890A). The amount of these products was determined from calibration curves using standard compounds for each instrument (Figure S1). Measurements of In Situ ATR-SEIRAS. Potential- and time-dependent in situ ATR-SEIRAS measurements of the samples were performed using the Cu film that was plated on a hemispherical Si ATR prism by the previously reported procedure.29,39 Spectra were recorded in the Kretschmann ATR configuration using a JASCO FT/IR4200 spectrometer equipped with a HgCdTe (MCT) detector. Electrochemical measurements were performed using a BAS ALS600 series electrochemical analyzer using Cu films as the working electrode, carbon paper as the counter electrode, and Ag/ AgCl (3 M NaCl) as the reference electrode. A 0.1 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte that was saturated with either Ar or CO2. These films were characterized and measured at least three times to confirm their reproducibility. DFT Calculations. To evaluate the reaction behavior at the Cu electrode, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Quantum-Espresso (Open-Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization).45 This program was embedded with the effective screening medium (ESM) method46,47 to calculate the external electric field or the bias potential and also with the reference interaction site model (RISM)48 to evaluate the distribution of the solvent, solute, and their potentials.49,50 In the Quantum-Espresso, we used the generalized gradient approximation parameterized by Perdew?Burke?Ernzerhof functionals. The projector augmented wave method was employed, and the kinetic cutoff energies for the wavefunctions and the charge density of plane wave were 540 and 4000 eV, respectively. The crystalline facets of pristine copper, (111), (100), (110), and (211), were approximated using a 3 ℅ 3 ℅ 3 slab in a 30 ? vacuum. Two lower layers of the supercell were fixed, and one upper layer was allowed to move freely due to the interaction with adsorbates. A smearing parameter of 0.54 eV using the Gaussian method was applied. The reciprocal space was sampled with an 8 ℅ 8 ℅ 1 Monkhorst-Pack mesh. The self-consistent field tolerance was set to 1 ℅ 10?8 eV/ atom. Adsorbates and the surface of Cu atoms were optimized until the magnitude of residual forces was below 0.0005 eV/?. ← RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Preparation and Characterization of the MT?Cu Electrode. The modifications of methanethiol on polycrystalline Cu, Cu(111), and Cu(100) were evaluated by XPS analysis, which showed a peak ascribed to S2p at approximately 163 eV (Figure 1, Figures S2, and S3, and Table S1). Other than the peak ascribed to S2p, the peak ascribed to Cu2P was also observed as similar binding energy on each electrode. The modification of methanethiol on Cu was also confirmed by in situ ATR-SEIRAS measurements, which is described in the section ※Surface analysis of each electrode before/after electrolysis§, in detail. We also attempted to evaluate electrochemical desorption of methanethiol in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution; however, the reductive current was not detected as well as previously described (Figure S4).40 https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.0c04106 ACS Catal. 2020, 10, 15238?15249"

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Ultimately, we conclude that the manipulation of the d-band center position of Cu(001) by tensile strain modulates the reaction pathway and alters the product distribution as seen in our experiments above. Comparing the activity for C2 + products to the activity of CO and CH4 formations is informative as the reaction path selected after *CO formation heavily relies on the *CO coverage.65 Figure 5B shows the ratio of the partial current density for C2 + products compared to that of C1 products, CO and CH4, with respect to the dband center position. It is clearly seen that selectivity for the C2 + products is higher on more strained films, where a stronger adsorption energy for reaction intermediates is expected due to the upshifted d-band center. Evidently, the ample *CO coverage resulting from tensile strain leads to C?C coupling that hampers both CO and CH4 formations. We propose that the selectivity for C2 + products on the Cu(001) surface with a higher d-band center is largely due to the increased adsorption energy for both *CO and *H, which together with their increasing surface coverages suppresses reaction pathways toward single-carbon products. In summary, we provide quantitative analysis of electrochemical CO2 reduction on model-strained Cu(001) surfaces to demonstrate strain engineering as a path to tune the product distribution. Increasing tensile strain is observed as the film thickness of the epitaxially grown Cu(001) film on Si(001) single-crystal substrates decreases. The tensile strain shifts the d-band center toward the Fermi level. The change in the electronic structure and resulting adsorbate interaction suppresses the kinetics for CO2 reduction to single-carbon products, while the activity for C2 + products is steady. The higher d-band center is positively correlated overall to enhancing selectivity for C2 + products relative to CO and CH4, suggesting an increase in adsorption energy and surface coverage of *CO and *H. At the same time, due to the linear scaling relation between *CO and *H, as tensile strain increases, the increasing favorability of hydrogen adsorption leads to hydrogen evolution outstripping the faradic current for CO2 reduction. These experimental demonstrations of the role of strain in model catalysts facilitate the rational design of nanoparticulate CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. The results of this work highlight the opportunity to design electrocatalysts explicitly using strain engineering to focus the reaction pathway toward highly energy-dense CO2 reduction products. ← EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Preparation of Epitaxial Cu(001) on Single-Crystal Si(001) Substrate. Single-side polished Si(001) wafers (University Wafers, p-type, 1?100 次﹞cm) are used as a substrate to achieve epitaxial growth of Cu(001) films. The wafers are diced into 2.15 ℅ 4.5 cm2 sized pieces that are sonicated in a mixture of acetone/IPA/DI water (6:3:1 v/v), followed by DI water for 10 min each and subsequently dried with a N2 gun. To remove the native oxide layer and trace amount of metal impurities, the substrates are immersed in 20 vol % of HF for 5 min and then transferred to 20 vol % of HCl solution for 5 min. Prior to Cu deposition, the cleaned substrates are submerged into 20 vol % of HF solution again to establish a H-terminated surface. Immediately after HF treatment, the Si substrates are transferred into an ultrahigh vacuum (‵4 ℅ 10?9 Torr) chamber for sputter deposition of Cu in an AJA ATC Orion DC magnetron sputtering system. The pressure and flow rate of Ar are set to be 3 mTorr and 10 sccm, respectively. Cu (99.999%, AJA) is sputtered at a rate of 1.73(8) ?/s at room temperature to fabricate 20, 30, 40, and 100 nm of Cu films. The thickness of the films and sputtering rate are carefully determined by a Dektak 150 surface profiler and a J.A. Woollam M-2000D spectroscopic ellipsometer (Figure S13). For the film-annealed postgrowth, we grow a 100 nm epitaxial Cu(001) film on a Si substrate at room temperature and subsequently annealed it at 65 ～C for 14 h in the high vacuum chamber (1.7 ℅ 10?8 Torr). The asprepared film catalysts are individually stored in a vacuum bag when not in use to inhibit partial oxidation of the film in ambient air."

It is thus essential to design new Cu?Sn composite catalysts for selective eCO2RR at a high yield and offer a platform to understand the role of Cu and Sn in the bimetallic system. In this work, we reported a series of bimetallic Cu?Sn composite catalysts with tunable chemical composition for eCO2RR. As illustrated in Figure 1, these catalysts were prepared by reducing CuCl2﹞2H2O and SnCl2﹞2H2O in an aqueous solution with sodium borohydride as the reductive agent. Pure Cu and Sn were also prepared as the reference in the same way. The prepared catalysts were denoted as CuxSny, and the x/y represent Cu/Sn feed molar ratio in the reaction (Cu/Sn ratio: from 50/1 to 1/2). Electrocatalytic measurements reveal that the products of CO2 reduction can be tuned selectively from HCOOH to CO by systematically varying the Cu/Sn ratio. As an ideal catalyst model, a linear relationship between the selectivity of CO2 reduction and Cu/Sn composition was formed. Compared with pure Cu or Sn"

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Electrochemistry. A BioLogic? VMP3 potentiostat was used for all electrochemical measurements including electrodeposition and CO2 electrolysis. A micro gas chromatograph (米GC, T-3000) from SRA-Instruments was used with a 5 ? MolSieve column and a thermal conductivity detector for the characterization of gaseous compounds. Liquid products were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) from Agilent Technologies with an ICE-Coregel 87-H3 column equipped with a 1260 Infinity Variable Wavelength Detector and a 1260 Infinity Refractive Index Detector for the detection of HCOOH and alcohols, respectively. A customized airtight, two-compartment, three-electrode cell was utilized with our samples as the working electrode, and Pt was isolated as the counter electrode. Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) was used as the reference electrode. The electrochemical reduction of CO2 was carried out using a 0.1 M KHCO3 solution (pH 6.8) under high stirring. The electrolyte was saturated with CO2 for at least 30 min before the start of each CO2 reduction, and the flowrate of CO2 was maintained at 10 mL min ?1 for all experiments. All potentials for CO2 reduction are reported with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Preparation of OD-Cu. The pristine Cu sheet (0.2 mm thickness, 99.9%) was cut into 1 ℅ 2 cm2 plates and washed with water before sonicating for 3 min in acetone. An etching solution of 2 M HNO3 was used to further clean the sheets from surface impurities. Copper plates were washed with nitric acid for 3 min under sonication and then washed at least three times with Milli-Q water. The etched copper plates were dried by blowing N2 gas after removal from water. The plates were then placed vertically in alumina crucibles and heated at 400 ～C for 2 h in a muffle furnace with static air under a ramping rate of 200 ～C h?1. Preparation of Sn. Sn metal sheet (0.1 mm thickness, 99.9%) was purchased from Nilaco Corporation (Japan) and cut into 3 ℅ 1 cm2 sheets. The sheets were washed with acetone and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 water before begin washed with 1 M HCl for a few seconds. When used as an anode in a twoelectrode system, an active surface area of 3.0 cm2 for Sn was maintained for each electrodeposition protocol. The Sn sheet used as a substrate for the electroplating of Sn was pretreated with 2 M HNO3 for 2 min, rinsed with Milli-Q water and dried with N2 gas. Electrodeposition of Sn on OD-Cu. Sn was electrodeposited on OD-Cu electrodes in a twoelectrode cell with Sn sheet as the anode. The electrolyte consisted of a solution of 0.05 M SnCl2﹞2H2O with 2 M KOH. Electrodeposition was carried out at a constant potential of ?0.5 V vs. Sn while varying the passing charge density either on pre-reduced OD-Cu (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1.5, and 2.0 C cm?2) or pristine OD-Cu (1.0, 4.0, 6.3, 8.0, 10.0 and 15.0 C cm?2). The prereduction of OD-Cu, prior to Sn electrodeposition, was conducted at ?0.6 V vs. RHE for 1 h followed by ?0.8 V vs. RHE for 1 h in CO2 reduction solution. The deposited amount determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements was also used to report in the unit of 米mol cm?2. Preparation of electrode made of commercial Cu-Sn alloy particles. Cu84Sn5 powder was annealed in a tube furnace under N2 at 1100 ～C for 5 h using an alumina boat, to form a rather flat bulk electrode of the alloy. The cooling step was performed under inert conditions, and the sample was exposed to air after reaching room temperature. A copper wire was soldered using indium to create a low-resistance ohmic contact with the alloy electrode, which was later sealed with epoxy to cover all connections, exposing only a well-defined active surface. Characterization of materials. ICP measurements were taken using a Varian 720-ES equipped with a charge coupled device (CCD) detector. All samples were digested in concentrated HNO3 using a microwave digestion system. Samples were diluted with 1% HNO3 prior to all measurements. A standard error of ㊣2 ppm was calculated based on the average of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 experimental standard deviations for each set of measurements. Sn standard solution (1000 ppm) was obtained from Inorganic Ventures and diluted for the calibration measurements. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 Advanced A25 diffractometer with a Cu X-ray tube (Cu每K汐; 竹 = 0.154 nm). The diffractometer operating conditions were 40 mA at 40 mV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a 3400 KRATOS AMICUS/ESCA with an unmonochromatized Al-anode K汐 X-ray source (1486.6 eV) operated at 15 mA and 10 kV (~ 1 ℅ 10?7 Pa). The binding energies were calibrated using the adventitious C 1s spectra with a reported binding energy of 284.8 eV, and the associated error was estimated to be at least ㊣0.2 eV to ㊣0.3 eV.32 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained at 5 keV using a NovaNano scanning electron microscope from FEI. Computational details. Electronic structure calculations based on DFT were performed using the revised Perdew每Burke每Ernzerhof (revPBE) exchange-correlation functional as implemented in VASP.33-36 Plane每wave basis sets (with a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV)37 describe the valence electrons: 11 electrons of Cu (3d104s1) and three electrons of Sn (5s25p2). We employed a 0.1 eV smearing of the Fermi level and (8℅8℅8) K-points for bulk calculations and (4℅4℅1) for surfaces. The core electrons were replaced by projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials.38,39 The relaxation of the atomic positions in the supercell occurred until the energy differences were smaller than 0.01 eV ??1. With this setup, we simulated the electronic structure of Cu/Sn alloys, the substitution of one Cu atom by a Sn atom in Cu nanoparticles, and the same substitution on regular Cu surfaces."

Then, an equimolar mixture of CuCl (3.5 mmol, Acros Organics, 99%) and the prepared NaInO2 powder was pressed into a pellet and treated in a tube furnace at 400 ～C for 12 h (5 ～C min?1) under flowing nitrogen. The resulting material was washed and centrifuged three times with deionized water to remove NaCl and then dried overnight at 80 ～C in a vacuum oven to obtain the final CuInO2 product. 2.2. Electrode preparation. Electrodes were prepared by airbrushing a catalyst ink on a gas diffusion layer (GDL). The ink was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the catalyst (50 mg) for 15 min in a mixture of ultrapure water (5 cm3), 2-propanol (5 cm3, Sigma- Aldrich, 99.8%) and Nafion? solution (50 米l, 5 wt.%, Sigma-Aldrich). This dispersion was then painted with an airbrush (Iwata Eclipse HP-SBS) on the microporous layer of a GDL (Sigracet 35BC, SGL Group, 12 cm2 cross-sectional area) which had been mounted on a hot plate at a temperature of 90 ～C. A catalyst loading of ca. 1.5 mg cm?2 was typically achieved in this manner. Finally, the electrodes were produced by cutting the GDL in L-shaped pieces and attaching them through the protrusion to a flat silver contact soldered to a copper wire. The resulting joint and the wire were covered with plenty of PTFE tape to avoid contact with the electrolyte, yielding square electrodes with an area of ca. 2.25 cm2. The electrodes were photographed and their total geometric area determined with the ImageJ software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of"

All prism Cu samples display perpendicularly grown triangular nanoprisms with different width of the top and bottom facets, while the planar electropolished Cu reference foil has a flat surface (Figure S2). In addition, the width of the prisms was more uniform and narrow with increasing additive concentra- tion (Janus Green B) and the side edge surface was found to roughen, which is expected to have a higher concentration of defect sites.

Herein, we describe the selective formation of formate over particulate sulfur-modified Cu (Cu-S) electrocatalysts prepared from sulfide precursors upon reductive reconstruction. The study of the influence of the particle size and sulfur content on the catalytic response unveiled a size-activity relationship correlating larger particle sizes with higher FEs to formate. Detailed characterization allowed us to gain insights on the catalytic role of sulfur, distribution, and chemical nature. In view of these results and the high practical relevance of formate as additive 23,24 and potential hydrogen carrier, 25-27 and its predicted leading role in breaking the barrier for eCO2RR implementation, 28 we developed a targeted preparation route toward practical systems comprising submicron-sized Cu-S that indeed exhibited enhanced performance (> 80% FEs at ?0.8 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode; RHE), outperforming reported earth-abundant and cost-effective materials for formate production via aqueous eCO2RR. 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 2.1.

A catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing the catalyst powder (50 mg) in a 1:1 mixture of ultrapure water (4 cm 3 ) and 2-propanol (4 cm 3 , Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) to which Nafion solution (50 mm 3 , 5 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 was also added as a binder phase. The resulting mixture was sonicated for 15 min and then was sprayed onto the GDL (Sigracet 39BC, SGL Group) with an airbrush (Iwata Eclipse HPSBS) at 353 K. A total powder loading of 1.5 mg cm ?2 was typically achieved for each electrode. 2.3. Electrochemical tests. A custom gas-tight glass cell with two compartments separated by a Nafion 212 membrane (Alfa Aesar, 0.05 mm thickness) was used for the electrochemical studies. Both chambers were filled with 40 cm 3 of a 0.1 M KHCO3 solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95% trace metals basis) prepared with ultrapure water. Before and during the measurement, CO2 (Messer, purity 4.8) was supplied to the catholyte at a flow rate of 20 cm 3 min ?1 , resulting in a pH of 6.7. A Pt wire and a Ag/AgCl (3.0 M KCl) were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrodes had a geometric area of ca. 1 cm 2 , which was accurately quantified for each electrode with the ImageJ image processing and analysis software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health). All measurements were performed employing an Autolab PGSTAT302N potentiostat at room temperature. Current densities were normalized by the geometric surface area; and potentials were iR corrected (impedance spectroscopy, 100 kHz, 10 mV amplitude), and referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)."

After 5 min equilibration time, a precursor solution containing CuOAc (0.1 mmol, 0.2 mmol and 0.4 mmol, 0.8 mmol for copper domain size of 15 nm, 24 nm, 36 nm and 54 nm respectively), 0.6 mmol of OLAM and 0.6 mmol of OLAC in 2.4 mL of degassed ODE was added to the stirring mixture at a rate of 0.18 mL/min using a syringe pump (Figure S2). Upon the addition of this precursor solution, the reaction mixture slowly turned from colourless to brown. After injection of 0.7 mL of the solution to the reaction mixture, the injection was stopped and the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature by removing the heating mantle. The HDs were then extracted and purified by repeated washing / centrifugation cycles; the HDs were handled inside a N2 glovebox to avoid oxidation of Cu prior to electrochemistry.

        "synthesis_paragraph": "The Cu-Sn alloy powders were synthesized from the reduction of copper and tin salts in solution with sodium borohydride. The obtained precipitates were then annealed at high temperature and cooled slowly to form the desired crystal phase (see the Experimental Section in the Supporting Information). X-ray diffraction (XRD) along with Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS) were used to determine the crystal phase and composition of each Cu-Sn alloy sample (Figure S1, Table S1). Surface compositions of the Cu-Sn alloys were also measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the data is shown alongside the ICP-MS data in Table S1. Both techniques generally gave compositions within 2 % of each other. Therefore, the compositions of the alloys were relatively homogenous. The XRD spectra of the samples showed various intermetallic phases of bronze (Figure S1), predominantly with I. J. K. and LM. bronzes. Specifically, Cu5Sn6 (naming of each sample herein is based on its composition) and Cu4Sn3 were predominantly LM. and K. bronzes (JCPDS Cards #45-1488, #01-1240), Cu3Sn2 was predominantly K. and J. bronzes (JCPDS Cards #01-1240, #30-0511), Cu7Sn4 was predominantly J. bronze (JCPDS Cards #31-0486), Cu4Sn was predominantly J. and I. and bronzes (JCPDS Cards #31-0486, #44-1477), and Cu12Sn was predominantly I. bronze (JCPDS Card #44-1477). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Figure S2) images show that the alloys show a similar micron level morphology and the distribution of Cu and Sn is homogenous throughout the alloys. To systematically evaluate the electrocatalytic CRR performance of the alloy samples, the Cu-Sn powders were deposited on carbon paper at a loading of approximately 1 mg cm-2. To normalize current responses between samples, mass loadings on each electrode were determined post electrochemical testing by acid leaching in hydrochloric acid and ICP-MS. From Figure 1a and Figure S3a, a clear trend 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 6 in CO selectivity and partial current (jCO) on a range of Cu-Sn alloys is observed (error bars for data presented in Figure 1a and 1b can be found in Table S2). Generally, all samples exhibit a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) around -0.8 V vs. RHE while FE for the hydrogen byproduct typically declines with increasing overpotential (Figure S4). Interestingly, the tin content in the sample seems to have a direct effect on the gas-phase products (CO and H2). Specifically, with decreasing tin content, significant enhancement to FE for CO is observed throughout the entire potential range (Figure 1a). Over the entire potential range, this resulted in an absolute average increase of 45 % FE between Cu5Sn6 and Cu12Sn. It should be noted that despite the significant change to FE, the mechanisms of both CO and formate generation remains similar on all samples as evidenced by their similar Tafel slopes (Figure S5). For liquid product efficiencies (only formate), it is generally observed that onset of significant FE and formate partial current (jHCOO-) occurs around -0.8 V vs. RHE (around the maximum of CO efficiency), as shown in Figure 1b and Figure S3b. All samples exhibit somewhat similar FE and jHCOO-, which suggests that formate generation is less sensitive to tin content in the Cu-Sn system compared to that of the CO product. Nevertheless, an enhancement of approximately 15 % FE for formate is observed with increasing tin content (Figure 1b), suggesting that formate is less favored on low tin alloys.15 To better visualize the selectivity trend, a linear relationship between formate selectivity (CRR products basis) and sample composition is observed (Figure 1c). From this we can clearly see that formate is favored over CO as the tin content in the alloy is increased. After long-term CRR, the Cu-Sn alloy powders were found to be somewhat more aggregated but the micron-level morphology remained similar to the bulk powders (Figure S6). Further, no obvious changes to the crystal structures were observed (Figure S7 and Figure S8), which suggests that the Cu-Sn phases are stable under CRR conditions and provide the active sites for catalysis. We note that peak shifts in the XRD patterns before and after stability testing may be the result of sample misalignment between tests. Despite this, relative peak positions remain the same. In order to better understand the reaction pathway observed for the Cu-Sn system, in situ Raman spectroscopy was carried out using a confocal Raman microscope. The Cu-Sn powders were deposited 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 7 on screen printed electrodes and studied using a thin electrolyte film (CO2 saturated 0.1 M KHCO3) while reduction potentials were applied. As probe samples, Cu12Sn and Cu5Sn6 were chosen because they were the most selective samples toward CO and formate (Figure 1), respectively. From Figure 2a and Figure 2d, weak bands arising at 1295 cm-1 and 1436 cm-1 are observed when the potential applied to Cu12Sn is stepped negatively from open-circuit potential (OCP). Given we observe no such peaks for control experiments with N2-saturated electrolyte or at OCP (Figure S9), it is likely these bands correspond to the +C-OH and +C-O stretching vibrations of *COOH, which is the precursor to the CO product.20-21 These bands are also observed for a Cu sample but appear broader and slightly blue shifted (Figure 2a), possibly indicating a weaker interaction of the surface with the carbon. Further, this intermediate is confirmed by a shoulder peak appearing around 1635 cm-1 with increasing overpotential, which can be attributed to the C=O asymmetric stretch associated with *COOH (Figure S10).20-21 For Cu5Sn6, only at more negative potentials (-0.66 V vs. RHE) does a broad band appear in Figure 2b at 1390 cm-1. A single band in this region has been ascribed to the symmetric stretch of an *OCHO species (a general precursor to formate) adsorbed in a bidentate configuration.21-23 Additionally, two other bands are observed for Cu5Sn6 which decrease in intensity with overpotential and are likely attributed to adsorbed carbonate (Figure 2c).20, 24 These bands are also detected for Cu12Sn (Figure 2d), but given the intensity and broadness of these bands, they may also be attributed to tin-carbonate species.25 A sample with moderate tin concentration (Cu7Sn4) was also studied using Raman spectroscopy to see whether intermediates could be detected. From Figure S11, the sample shows features from both Cu12Sn and Cu5Sn6, with bands related to *COOH appearing at 1340 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 and broader bands appearing around 1100 cm1 and 1200 cm-1 similar to those of Cu5Sn6. Bands related to *COOH quickly disappear with overpotential which suggests that the surface coverage of this intermediate drops with increasing overpotential (Figure 1a). From the in situ spectroscopy results combined with the electrochemical measurements, the following reaction scheme is devised. Cu-Sn samples with low tin content favour a pathway to CO via a C-bound 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 8 *COOH intermediate. However, with increasing overpotential, the *OCHO intermediate becomes competitive with the *COOH intermediate and formate is produced parallel to CO. Affinity for the *COOH intermediate decreases for samples with higher tin content and therefore selectivity to CO decreases while a pathway to formate via *OCHO is preferred. Density functional theory (DFT) was then employed to elucidate mechanistic details for *COOH and *OCHO intermediate adsorption experimentally observed for the Cu-Sn system. The thermodynamic energetics of the CRR were calculated for Sn-1 and Sn-2 alloys which we assign as models for Cu12Sn and Cu5Sn6 experimental samples, respectively (see Computational Methods in the Supporting Information). Given our spectroscopic observations and the results from electrochemical measurements, the C-bound *COOH intermediate was used as the main intermediate in the CO production pathway, while the O-bound *OCHO intermediate was used in the formate production pathway.26 The free energy diagrams of the CRR to CO and formate on the three Cu-based models are shown in Figure S13. From Figure 3a, we see that with addition of a Sn site to the Cu surface (Sn-1), *COOH shows weaker adsorption while *OCHO adsorption is not greatly affected. With the addition of another Sn site, there is a significantly stronger *OCHO interaction and further weakening to *COOH adsorption. This was found to manifest in a selectivity trend of free energy difference between *COOH and *OCHO intermediates 1TE[*COOH-*OCHO]) across the models which agrees well with the experimental selectivity trend observed (Figure 3b). Density of states (DOS) analysis was performed on the three catalyst models to reveal the origin of this transformation to intermediate adsorption behavior. From this, a better view on electronic structure and composition dependent selectivity could be devised for the system. As shown in Figure 4a, the dorbital DOS position shifted negatively from the Fermi level (EF) with increasing Sn concentration. The d-band centre of Cu, Sn-1, and Sn-2 was plotted against the free energy of *COOH, resulting in a linear trend (Figure 4b). A weaker *COOH adsorption was related to a lower DOS position, indicating decreasing competition of *COOH adsorption with higher Sn content, agreeing with Figure 3a. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 9 Furthermore, the variation of *COOH adsorption strength was analysed to indicate the trend of CO selectivity. An experimental volcano relation is observed in Figure 4c by plotting CO partial current at - 0.76 V vs. RHE against the Sn content in the alloys. Clearly, Cu12Sn appeared near the volcano top, suggesting its favourability for CO production, while alloys with more tin concentration and pure copper all showed lesser preference for CO. When using the free energy of *COOH as a descriptor for CO generation, a similar volcano plot was constructed treating Sn-1 and Sn-2 as models for Cu12Sn and Cu5Sn6, respectively (Figure 4d). With Cu on the strong binding leg, Sn-1 at the volcano peak and Sn-2 on the weak binding leg, the plots match well between experiments and theoretical calculations. Therefore, the addition of tin surface sites appears to gradually shift the d-band centre negatively from the Fermi level which causes a gradual weakening to *COOH adsorption. Bader charge analysis was conducted to study the charge distribution on the Cu-Sn surface to reveal electronic effects that may be responsible for the observed selectivity trend. It was found that the Sn donates charge to the Cu and is positively charged in the Cu-Sn alloys (Figure S14). This result is also consistent with a recent in situ XAS study which found that Sn in a CuSn3 alloy exists in a SnJ? state under reduction potentials.27 Here we analyzed the chemical states of the Cu and Sn in the Cu-Sn alloys ex situ using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). High resolution Cu 2p spectra can be found in Figure S15. It should also be noted that electrochemically reduced Cu-based catalysts re-oxidize rapidly in air, which compromises the accuracy of ex-situ methods for determining the real active sites. Therefore, the samples were etched 20 nm with Ar plasma in situ which appeared to significantly reduce the surface oxides present (Figure S16). In the Cu 2p region (Figure 5a), the characteristic Cu 2p3/2 peak around 932.4 eV is observed for the Cu sample which suggests predominantly zero valent Cu states present.28 However, a negative shift in the Cu 2p3/2 peak is observed with increasing tin content which indicates some charge redistribution to the Cu.29 In contrast, from the Sn 3d spectra (Figure S17), the characteristic Sn 3d5/2 peak appears to shift positively with increasing Cu content. This suggests that upon alloying Cu and Sn some charge is redistributed from the Sn to Cu sites.30 We find that this is in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 agreement with the Bader charge analysis and we link a lower Cu 2p3/2 peak position to increased negative charge on the Cu sites (Figure 5b), leading to a positive charge on the Sn sites. This likely has significant impact to intermediate adsorption behaviour and reaction selectivity because when CO2 is polarized, its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is highly localized on the carbon, making it susceptible to nucleophiles.31 However, having regions of localized positive charge on the catalyst surface may hinder nucleophilic attack on the carbon and increase the thermodynamic barrier to *COOH adsorption. As a result, a pathway through the *OCHO intermediate is likely preferred over the *COOH intermediate, rendering CO formation less favourable for alloys with increased Sn content (Figure 5c)."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "COOH*. Within the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model, the predicted theoretical onset potential to produce formate on CuS (110) is ?0.73 V vs RHE, with a larger potential of ?0.98 V vs RHE predicted to activate the COOH* pathway with both predictions being higher than what is observed experimentally. However, we note that the FE value toward formate, summarized in Figure S8, increases substantially in the vicinity of ?0.7 vs RHE, which may coincide with the activation of the OCHO*-mediated CO2RR pathway to formic acid on CuS (110). The incorporation of surface OS species, as expected for the Cu2O/CuS nanocomposites, can preferentially stabilize both OCHO* and COOH* intermediates, with COOH* binding being enhanced more, because of a stronger interaction with O surface sites, relative to S sites (Figures S10 and S11 in the Supporting Information). We considered OS occupying both unique S sites in CuS, substituting on both the nondimer and dimer S surface sites, which we denote as S0 and S1, respectively. With OS present, the COOH*-mediated pathway can become more favorable than the OCHO*-mediated pathway, with the most favorable case arising from COOH* adsorbing to an OS0 site. The calculated theoretical overpotential associated with this COOH* adsorption step is only ?0.11 V vs RHE, indicating that CO produced via a COOH*mediated pathway on surface OS sites may be dominant at lower overpotentials. This may be consistent with the low FE for formate at the lowest overpotentials in Figure S8, but requires additional study of the gas-phase products to identify whether CO is being produced. The hydrogen evolution is also a competitive reduction process that also preferentially involves anion sites rather than at Cu sites (Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). We find that the interaction of H* with OS to be problematically favorable, as the reduction of the surface OS0 and OS1 sites and the formation of H2O and surface vacancies is predicted to occur already at 0 V vs RHE (Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). Thus, surface OS species are expected to be short-lived under CO2RR conditions, with the formation of surface sulfur vacancies (VS) likely and consistent with the XPS spectra shown in Figure 2. The influence of VS on the OCHO*- and COOH*-mediated pathways is also considered in Figures 4c and 4d, as well as Figures S14 and S15 in the Supporting Information, where we find that they have a significant effect. We find that the formation of undercoodinated Cu from VS0 lead to a much stronger binding of OCHO* intermediates, lowering the predicted onset potential to ?0.13 V vs RHE for formate production. For surface vacancies at the dimer sites, we found VS1 lead to a stabilization of COOH* at the undercoordinated S site and lowers the predicted overpotential to adsorb CO2 on the surface via a COOH*-mediated pathway to ?0.33 V vs RHE. We note that these COOH* intermediates tethered to undercoordinated surface S species exhibit exposed C atoms that may also participate in coupled-proton electron transfers in competition with the O and OH, providing another possible route to HCOOH formation instead of CO + H2O. We also note that these potentials predicted to initiate CO2RR to formate are also slightly below that computed for competitive hydrogen adsorption and hydrogen evolution to H2, which we predict occurs at a potential of ?0.4 V (?0.9) vs RHE on S (Cu) sites on CuS(110) (Figure S12). These results support the idea that formic acid production may proceed via OCHO* and possibly COOH* intermediates on CuS(110) and that surface OS and VS species should enhance the activity of CO2RR and selectivity toward HCOOH, consistent with the XPS surface characterization and electrochemical measurements on Cu2O/CuS. Furthermore, we believe the presence of CuS is responsible for the improved electrochemical stability of Cu2O in the Cu2O/CuS nanocomposites under CO2RR conditions. According to previous studies,52?57 a gradient band structure is expected to form at the heterojunction of CuS and Cu2O, promoting the photo-excited electron transfer from Cu2O to CuS and, thus, protecting Cu2O from reduction. Our characterization results, calculations, and long-term stability data provide indirect evidence to support this mechanism. TEM results confirm the presence of Cu2O in the CuS/Cu2O composite catalyst after CO2RR. In addition, the stable formate generation over 30 h suggests the CuS/Cu2O catalyst is long-lived, in contrast to other previously reported Cu2O catalysts. Taken together, these results reveal the essential role of CuS in stabilizing Cu2O during CO2RR. This is also supported by computed results that S removal from the CuS (110) surface under reduction conditions is not favorable (Figure S12); thus, it is expected that charge transfer to sulfide should enhance the stability of the surface under CO2RR. ← CONCLUSION In summary, we have prepared a new Cu2O/CuS nanocomposite catalyst via multistep conversion from Cu2S. The Cu2O/CuS shows outstanding catalytic performance for formate generation via CO2RR, achieving a FE of 67.6% and a jHCOO? value of 15.3 mA/cm 2 for formate at ?0.9 V vs RHE, which outperforms most other Cu, CuS, or Cu2O catalysts. DFT simulations indicate that CuS (110) surfaces exhibit a preferential selectivity toward HCOOH over CO, with substitutional surface OS or vacancy VS species expected to lead to reduced onset potentials and enhanced catalytic activities, with both COOH*- and OCHO*-mediated CO2RR pathways expected to contribute. Cu2O/CuS maintained an excellent FE (62.9%) and jHCOO? (12.3 mA/cm 2) toward formate at ?0.9 V vs RHE during the 30-h stability test, suggesting that the incorporation of CuS could stabilize Cu2O during the CO2RR. These findings open new opportunities in the design of low-cost Cu2O-based catalysts for CO2RR and provide additional insight into the influence of sulfide phases in the selective production of formate. ← EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Synthesis. Synthesis of Cu2S proceeds a follows. 0.032 g of sulfur powder (sublimed sulfur) and 0.364 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were dissolved in 25 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring. Then, 1 mL of hydrazine monohydrate was added into the solution. Cu gauze (2 cm ℅ 2 cm, 140 mesh with 0.056 mm diameter wire) was cleaned in 85% H3PO4 for 1 min, followed by successive sonication steps in deionized water, acetone, and ethanol. Cu gauze and the S containing solution were transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 180 ～C for 12 h. The autoclave was then cooled to room temperature. The Cu gauze was uniformly coated with Cu2S and became gray in color. The prepared Cu2S catalyst was rinsed with deionized water and dried under vacuum overnight."

After that, the product was dispersed in hydrochloric acid (4 M) and the mixture https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c09755 ACS Nano 2021, 15, 4927?4936 was stirred for 20 h at room temperature. Then the dispersion was washed for 6 times with argon-saturated water and sonicated for 20 h. Finally, SA-Cu-MXene was obtained after freeze-drying treatment for 48 h. The synthetic procedures of Cu-particles-MXene and MXene were similar to that of SA-Cu-MXene except that Ti3(Al0.9Cu0.1)C2 and Ti3AlC2 were used as the MAX phase precursors, respectively. Materials Characterization. The morphologies and microstructures of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (JEOL-7500) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (JEOL, NEM-2100F). X-ray diffraction (Rigaku D/max2500PC) was carried out using Cu K汐 radiation over the range of 5?80～. Chemical states were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Thermo Escalab 250Xi). Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field?scanning transmission electron microscopy was performed on double aberrationcorrected TEM 0.5 microscopy at 300 kV using a high-angle annular detector, resulting in ※Z-contrast§ images. Electron energy loss spectroscopy experiment was conducted at an aberration-corrected JEOL ARM 200 microscopy. The energy resolution is about 0.6 eV. The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra were conducted at the 1W1B station of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The storage rings of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility were carried out at 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA. A Veeco/ Bruker (ICON) atomic force microscope was used to characterize the thickness of the sample. The Cu contents in the SA-Cu-MXene were measured by ICP-ASE (Optima-7000DV). The electrical conductivity was tested by a four-point-probe method by a resistivity tester (Suzhou Jingge, China). Analysis of XAFS Data. The experimental data of XAFS were processed in the standard procedures with the ATHENA module implemented in IFEFFIT software packages.49,50 After subtraciting the post-edge background from the overall absortion and normalizing with respect of the edge jump step, the EXAFS spectra were gained. Then the Fourier transformation of 聿(k) data in k-space ranging from 2.1 to 10.6 ??1 was carried out by using Hanning windows (dk = 1.0 ??1) and the EXAFS contributions was separated from various coordination shells. The quantitative data could be obtained by leastsquares curve fitting in R-space with the Fourier transform k-space range of 2.1 to 10.6 ??1, with the module ARTEMIS of programs in IFEFFIT. Electrochemical Measurement. All electrochemical experiments were conducted in a typical gastight two-compartment H-type threeelectrode electrochemical cell with cation exchange membrane (Nafion-115, ‵4 cm2) as the compartment separator. A glass carbon electrode coated with catalysts was used in the cathode compartment as a working electrode; the catalysts loading was 0.29 mg cm?2. An Ag/AgCl (KCl-saturated) electrode and a carbon rod electrode were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. In a typical preparation procedure of the working electrode, 4 mg of the catalyst and 80 米L of Nafion solution (5 wt %) were dispersed into 0.92 mL of water and ethanol solution with a volume ratio of 4:1. Then, 5 米L of the solution was loaded onto a glass carbon electrode (0.07 cm2) to prepare a working electrode. All electrocatalytic experiments were carried out with a CO2 gas flow rate of 3 sccm to saturated CO2 in the electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement was recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s?1 in the potential between 0 and ?2.0 V vs RHE. The electrolyte in the cathode compartment was stirred during the electrocatalytic reaction of 30 min for each applied potential. Durability tests were performed at ?1.4 V vs RHE for 30 h. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy plots were tested with an amplitude of 5 mV in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. All potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) reference scale by the following equation: V(RHE) = V(Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 + 0.059pH. During the reaction, gas phase products were analyzed and quantified by gas chromatography (Agilent 7890A). The liquid product was detected by a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz system with water suppression. DFT Calculations. All of the first-principles spin-polarized calculations were performed by using the Vienna ab initio simulation program (VASP).51,52 For the exchange?correlation energy of interacting electrons, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the parametrization of Perdew?Burke?Ernzerhof (PBE) was used.53 To representing the nonvalence core electrons, the projector augmented wave function (PAW) method was used.54 In this work, the MXene functionalized by O atoms is modeled as a monolayer 2D sheet in a supercell consisting of a 3 ℅ 3 unit cell (Ti27C18O18). For Cu particles, we used a 3 ℅ 3 unit cell of Cu(100) surface model. The Cu(100) slab has four atom layers, in which the top two layers of the surfaces together with the adsorbed species were allowed to relax, while the bottom two layers were kept fixed to represent the bulk properties. A vacuum space exceeding 20 ? was employed to avoid the interaction between two periodic units. To ensure our calculation accurate, for all geometry relaxation calculations reported herein, we used a 500 eV cutoff for the kinetic energy of the plane-wave basis set, and a 5 ℅ 5 ℅ 1 Monkhorst?Pack55 k grid was used for sampling the Brillouin zones at structure calculation. The convergence criteria of structure optimization were chosen as the maximum force on each atom less than 0.02 eV ??1 with an energy change less than 1 ℅ 10?5 eV. The Grimme DFT-D3 scheme of dispersion correction was adopted to describe the van der Waals (vdW) interactions in these layered systems.56"

Then, the metal precursors (Cu(NO3)2-Co(NO3)2) methanol solution was dropwise injected to the ZIFs nhexane solution under ultrasound at the room temperature. After stirring, washing and drying, the samples were calcined at 900 oC under a N2 atmosphere for 2 h. By changing the Cu(NO3)2Co(NO3)2 ratios, a series of CuCox nanoparticles was successfully prepared, where x represents the actual Co/Cu atomic ratio. The actual Co/Cu ratios were shown in Table S1 according to the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)."

The trioctylamine was then cooled to room temperature; while keeping the flask purged with argon,123 mg of copper (I) acetate (Sigma Aldrich, 97%) and 139 mg of ntetradecylphosphonic acid (TCI Synthesis, Lot # 808002N09) were added to the trioctylamine. The solution was then rapidly heated to 180 oC under argon, swirled briefly to release any precursors adhered to the walls of the flask, and kept at this temperature for 30 minutes. The solution was rapidly heated to 270 oC and held at that temperature for 30 minutes. After cooling to room temperature, the copper particles were removed using air-free techniques and transferred to a glovebox. Just prior to electrode fabrication, 0.15 mL of the as-synthesized particles in trioctylamine was diluted with 0.75 mL of hexane, and then precipitated by adding 1.4 mL of isopropanol, under air-free conditions. The particles were separated by centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 8 minutes. The solvent was decanted under ambient conditions, and the particles were resuspended in 1 mL of hexane by vortexing. The volume of hexane in which the particles are resuspended can be changed in order to optimize the particle loading on glassy carbon; this is critical for achieving high methanation yields."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "C2+ products. This will lead to an increase in C2+ product selectivity, because an increased surface coverage of *CO is known to both promote CO dimerization and also weaken *H adsorption that can inhibit the HER.24 This microscopic hydrophobicity emphasizes the interaction of the polymer and CO2 at the first ML and need not be related to the macroscopic hydrophobicity of the polymer film. The latter can be accurately measured experimentally but does not correlate well with CO2 reduction to C2+ products. 12h Although it is more relevant to the CO2 reaction, the microscopic hydrophobicity in the first ML is hard to determine from the experiment. Instead, the surface charge has been demonstrated to be an effective descriptor of microscopic hydrophobicity that can correlate with CO2 reduction performance,12g,h because the charge distribution and produced electric field reflect the overall effect of the distribution of cations and anions. This specific distribution, in turn, determines the amount of electric charge stored in the double-layer capacitor that significantly affects the electrochemical reaction, because such an electric field regulates the orientation of water, either with OH pointing to the surface or not.26 The UFF force field uses the Qeq method27 to calculate the charge, which has been validated to reproduce QM charges.28 Figure 8d shows the comparisons of surface charges for water/Cu and random copolymer 8 + water/Cu. We see that the surface charge of water/Cu (per atom) is +0.06 and that of polymer 3 + water/Cu is +0.06, while that of polymer 8 + water/Cu is +0.03. These simulation results suggest that random copolymer 8 + water/Cu leads to improved microscopic hydrophobicity in comparison to water/Cu, explaining why it increases the local concentration of CO2 in the IHP. In addition, the porosity of the polymer is expected to be important for mass transport.29 The experimental results show that the selectivity of the CO2RR for the random copolymer 8 is better than that of the block copolymer block-8. In order to understand these experimental results, we compared a simulation model of block-8 with random copolymer 8. We find that block-8 is more ordered and less porous than random copolymer 8. This decrease in porosity should decrease the mass transfer of reactants, especially CO2, explaining the worse CO2 reduction performance of block-8. To quantify the structure difference between random copolymer 8 and block8, we compared the ratio between the effective volume of the polymer at the electrode (V) with that of just the polymer (V0). A larger V/V0 indicates increased porosity, which should lead to increased CO2 reduction. As shown in Figure 8e, the random copolymer 8 has V/V0 13% larger porosity in comparison to block-8, explaining the experimental observation. This suggests the permeability of CO2 gas is important in polymer design. The above effects also influence the induced electric field at the interface. The electric field, arising from both the surface charge and the charge distribution, has been demonstrated as an effective descriptor for CO2 reduction. 19b As shown in Figure 8f, we found that the CO2 reduction performance correlates with electric field strength, leading to a volcano curve, with random copolymers 7?9 located close to the peak. This explains the enhanced performance of these polymers, suggesting that the surface electric field intensity may be a useful descriptor for in silico discovery of improved polymer materials for CO2 reduction, especially for such complex systems as polymer-modified heterogeneous electrocatalysis https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c12478 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 2857?2865 interfaces. Due to the complexity of the system, linear regression, taking into account all possible descriptors, might be a good way to correlate the experimental results with the interface structure as revealed from the MD simulations. Although the current data set is too limited for regression analysis, we will consider gathering more data, either from experiment or by augmentation from simulations, to facilitate a robust prediction model in the future. ← CONCLUSION In summary, a new strategy for enhancing the selectivity for the CO2RR using a heterogeneous Cu catalyst was realized by employing a series of random copolymers as the surface modifier. A unique tricomponent copolymer was identified to provide optimal Faradaic efficiencies of ethylene (55%) and C2+ products (77%). A surface characterization indicates the robustness of the film under CO2RR conditions, which is enabled by the incorporation of a phenylpyridinium component. Nanostructuring effects and electronic effects were ruled out by AFM, SEM, and XPS studies. A further MD simulation demonstrated that the presence of the optimal polymer modifier increases the local CO2 concentration. In comparison with the corresponding block copolymer, the random copolymer is more porous, allowing access and mass transport of the reactants. In addition, the interfacial electric field plays an important role in performance enhancement. Future efforts will focus on employing this strategy on nanostructured Cu catalyst and gas-diffusion electrodes.30 ← EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Electrode Preparation. The surface preparation of Cu prior to each experiment consisted of mechanical polishing (1600 sandpaper, 3M) until no discoloration was visible and then electropolishing in phosphoric acid potentiostatically at 2.1 V for 40 min versus a graphite foil (0.13 mm thick, Alfa Aesar, 99.8% metals basis) counter electrode placed at a distance of ‵1.5 cm. The Cu foil was subsequently washed with ultrapure water and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. A methanol solution of the polymer (300 米L, 5 mg/mL) was dropped onto the electropolished Cu, which was rotated at 3000 rpm for 60 s by using a LAURELL WS-400BZ-6NPP/LITE spin coater. After deposition by spin coating, the electrode was further annealed at 70 ～C for 10 min. Chronoamperometry (CA). CA experiments were conducted in the cell with a CO2 flow rate of 5 sccm using a Biologic potentiostat (VSP-300). Prior to CA experiments, linear scan voltammetry was conducted from the open circuit potential to ?1.05 V vs RHE at a scan rate of 20 mV/s in order to reduce any oxidized Cu. The impedance was then measured, and a correction for the ohmic resistance was applied to the CA experiment. Each trial was run at ?1.08 V vs RHE for 64 min. The outlet of the electrochemical cell was connected to an in-line gas chromatograph (GC), and the gaseous products were injected into the chromatograph every 4.2 min. At the end of the experiment, the liquid from both the cathode and the anode was analyzed via 1H NMR spectroscopy to quantify the amounts of formic acid, ethanol, and n-propanol. The product selectivity and activities are reported in terms of Faradaic efficiencies (FE) and total current densities (mA/cm2). The Faradaic efficiency of a specific product was calculated as the ratio between the moles of a product produced by the electrode and the equivalents of electrons passed through the electrode. All potentials were converted from the Ag/AgCl scale to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale by using ERHE = EAg/AgCl ? 0.197 ? 0.059 ℅ pH, where ERHE, EAg/AgCl, and pH are the potential vs RHE, the measured potential vs the Ag/ AgCl reference electrode, and pH of the electrolyte (6.8).

        "synthesis_paragraph": "At lower wavenumbers (400?640 cm?1), our operando Raman spectroscopy measurements on a hierarchical Cu electrode reveal that peaks originated from surface CuOx disappeared immediately once negative currents were applied (Figure 5e), suggesting the reduction of surface oxide to metallic Cu. Meanwhile, several characteristic Raman peaks emerge, which arise from the Cu?CO (‵360 cm?1), CO2? (‵700, ‵1310, and ‵1550 cm?1), and CO32? (‵1070 cm?1) modes,49,55 respectively. The noticeable Cu?CO band at a large applied current density of 200 mA cm?2 indicates stable interaction between *CO and the Cu surface (Figure 5e), which supports the perspective that the hierarchical Cu electrode can stabilize the *CO intermediate and promote C?C coupling. After removing the current, the electrode surface was quickly reoxidized to Cu2O (Figure S45), consistent with our experimental observations above (Figures S31 and S32). Now we come to discuss the intrinsic factors that lead to the marked efficiency and stability of our designed Cu electrode in catalyzing CO2RR to C2+ fuels at commercially relevant current densities (e.g., 300 mA cm?2). We outline two important scenarios for the performance enhancement. First, the hierarchical Cu architecture that mimics Setaria＊s leaves induces remarkable water resistance and creates a robust CO2?electrolyte?Cu triple-phase boundary at the electrode, which allows for omnidirectional CO2 mass transfer, giving rise to a high local concentration of CO2 trapped near the active CO2RR surface. Moreover, the hydrophobicity of the electrode is rooted in its unique hierarchically sharp structure, which is highly stable to prevent flooding even at high-current operation. Nevertheless, the wettable Cu particulate electrode is readily flooded during CO2RR, and therefore the pathway of CO2 transfer is largely blocked, causing low CO2 concentration close to the catalyst for reaction. Second, we find clear evidence for the promoted C?C coupling on the hierarchical Cu electrode from our operando Raman spectroscopy tests. This is caused by the locally concentrated K+ ions at the highly structured electrode, which renders an alkali-metal-cation effect that not only stabilizes intermediates but also reduces the barrier of forming C?C bonds. As a consequence, we surmise that the new hierarchical electrode design allows for a robust gas?liquid?solid triple-phase boundary, sufficient CO2 mass transfer, and the favorable alkali-metal-cation effect, which together lead to advances in selectivity for C2+ production at large current densities, in stark contrast to the ordinary performance observed experimentally on the Cu particulate counterpart. https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c01190 J. Am. Chem. Soc. XXXX, XXX, XXX?XXX ← CONCLUSION In conclusion, the work reported here showcases that hierarchically structuring Cu needles on a GDL can lead to stable hydrophobicity of a CO2RR electrode without any hydrophobic coating. Besides preventing the GDL from being flooded, the obtained electrode can trap a gaseous layer near its surface, giving rise to a high local CO2 concentration that improves the CO2RR selectivity to C2+ products. Consequently, the electrode was very stable at a commercially relevant current density (here 300 mA cm?2) owing to the robust electrode?electrolyte interface guaranteed by the hydrophobicity. This bioinspired design thus suggests an electrode structuring route of creating a stable gas?liquid? solid triple-phase boundary that permits electrosynthesis of multicarbon fuels at industry-scale current densities. ← EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Material Synthesis. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. The GDL (SGL 29BC) used in this work was purchased from Fuel Cell Store. The Cu dendrite catalyst was directly electrodeposited on the GDL. To improve the repeatability of the electrodeposition, the gas diffuse carbon paper was first treated by air plasma prior to catalyst deposition. The plating bath was a 0.1 M CuSO4﹞5H2O solution in deionized water (DIW) with pH = 2 adjusted by 2 M H2SO4. The Cu dendrite thin film was deposited under a constant potential of ?0.7 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for 700 s in a three-electrode configuration where the Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) and Pt mesh were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The as-deposited film was rinsed with DIW and ethanol and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 ～C for 4 h. The Cu particle catalyst was prepared by a hydrothermal method. In detail, 2 mmol of cupric(II) acetylacetonate (Cu(C5H7O2)2), 4 mL of propylamine (C3H7NH2), and 2 mL of 80% hydrazine hydrate (N2H4﹞H2O) were mixed in 30 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The above solution was put into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 200 ～C for 8 h. Then the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. The assynthesized Cu particle catalyst was rinsed with DIW and ethanol and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 ～C for 4 h. The Fouriertransform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and baseline test were performed to ensure that no ethanol remained on the electrode before the CO2 electrolysis (Figure S17). Material Characterizations. Optical microscope images were obtained with a polarizing microscope (Leica DM2700P, Germany) equipped with a Leica MC190 HD camera. The morphology of the samples was determined by SEM (Zersss Supra 40) and TEM (JEOL 2010F(s)). HRTEM images were taken on a JEMARM 200F atomic resolution analytical microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. ICP-AES data were obtained by an Optima 7300 DV instrument. XRD was performed on a Japan Rigaku DMax-污A X-ray diffractometer with Cu K汐 radiation (竹 = 1.541 78 ?). XAS was carried out at the BL11U beamline of National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory in Hefei, China. Water contact angles and CO2 bubble adhesion behaviors were analyzed via an OCA20 machine (DataPhysics, Germany) at room temperature. A water droplet with a ‵3 mm diameter was generated on a hydrophobic needle with a syringe driven by an infusion and withdrawal pump at 0.05 mL/min. Then water droplets were released to impact the surface of the electrodes. Simultaneously, the side-view images of the droplet were captured. For the measurements of CO2 bubble adhesion, the sample was clamped flat in a transparent quartz container and immersed in KHCO3 solution, and an individual CO2 bubble (about 2.0 米L) was injected from the syringe needle under solution to the electrode surface. In-situ Raman spectra were taken on a Raman microscope (Renishaw) with a 785 nm excitation laser. The CO2RR postreaction electrode was washed by deionized water and stored in a vacuum oven before measurements. Note that postreaction characterizations of water contact angles and CO2 bubble adhesion behaviors of electrodes were performed after 10 h of CO2 electrolysis. Electrodes after CO2 electrolysis at a total current density of 300 mA cm ?2 for 10 min were also studied by SEM, XRD, and XPS."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Although pulsed electrolysis has shown remarkable results for controlling the catalyst selectivity, the majority of data available originate from experiments conducted in an H-type cell configuration. However, the current density of CO2RR in an H-type cell can only reach a few tens of mA/cm2 due to the low solubility of CO2 in the electrolyte and the resulting mass transfer limitations.27,28 In addition, single crystals that were previously discussed are less attractive for commercial applications due to the limited possibilities to scale up the process and the high catalyst cost. In this regard, a gas-fed flow cell configuration with a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) in an alkaline electrolyte provides an attractive alternative for industrial utilization. It features the three-phase boundary of a CO2 gas/liquid/solid interface, can achieve high current density (over 200 mA/cm2),27?31 and allows using nanoparticulate catalysts.32 However, the practical feasibility of such a system depends on the gas-fed flow cell characteristics. Harsh experimental conditions associated with high current densities are expected to affect the chemical and physical properties of the catalysts.27 Consequently, operando studies in the flow cell configuration are required to shed light on the correlation between the pulsed CO2RR parameters and the observed selectivity trends. Previous studies of the pulsed CO2RR in H-type cells have reported that oxidative potentials are beneficial for hydrocarbon and alcohol production.21,23 Here we extend such studies to a flow cell configuration and high current densities, using highly active shape-selected Cu2O nanocube (Cu NC) catalysts. Herein we demonstrate that pulsed electrolysis in a gas-fed flow cell configuration enables efficient control over the product selectivity, allowing us to switch from C2 (C2H4 and C2H5OH) to C1 (CH4) product formation by tuning the value of the applied anodic potential (Ean). To this end, in our pulsed protocol we use higher oxidative potential values than those in previous studies. Such high oxidative pulsed potentials can potentially lead to the transient oxidation of CO2RR products, which might have discouraged researchers from exploring wider potential ranges. However, here we show that oxidation of C2 CO2RR products during the pulses is negligible for the chosen potential range (up to ≒1.2 V vs RHE) and pulse duration (1 s) and that the changes in FE observed are likely related to interfacial pH and structural catalyst changes. Cyclic voltammetry, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), operando surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements allowed us to extract correlations between the catalytic properties and the structure and chemical state of the catalyst. 2.1. Preparation of Cu NCs and Electrodes. Cu NCs were prepared by modifying a previously reported procedure.32,33 In a typical synthesis, a dilute alkaline solution containing Cu ions was prepared by adding 8 mL of a CuSO4﹞6H2O solution (0.1 M) and 28 mL of a NaOH solution (1 M) to 732 mL of ultrapure water at room temperature. After the mixture was stirred for 10 s, 32 mL of an L-ascorbic acid solution (0.25 M) was added. The solution was then stirred for a further 13 min. The solution was centrifuged and washed several times with water and ethanol. To prepare the electrodes on a GDE, a catalyst ink was made by dispersing 0.5 mg of the catalyst powder with ‵22 wt % of Nafion (relative to the total loading, Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 mL of methanol."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "In this study, we synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles which were directly grown on a carbon black by using cysteamine and applied for CO2RR electrocatalysts. Interestingly, it was revealed that the initial 20 nm Cu2O NP/C was gradually fragmented into 2~4 nm particles, which were densely contacted with each other, over few hours of CO2RR. Cu-based NP/C catalyst exhibited increasing C2H4 production highly related with the morphological deformation, and reached up to 57.3 % of F.E.C2H4, one of the highest values for C2H4. H2 production was also highly suppressed compared with those of nonfragmented nanoparticle or bulk Cu foil. In-situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis during the long term CO2RR supports the electrochemical fragmentation of the nanoparticle induces high selectivity for CO2 to C2+ conversion, which can be applied for the design of the efficient catalysts. 2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 2.1 Synthesis of Cu-based nanoparticles (NPs). A simple one-pot wet-chemical synthesis is developed to prepare Cu-based NPs directly grown on carbon supports. In addition to a Cu metal precursor and carbon powder support, cysteamine molecules were added as immobilization agents which assisted nucleation of NPs on the carbon support.30 Two types of NPs were prepared by controlling the growth temperature and the retention time which affect the size of the particle as well as the shape. The size of the nanoparticle has been reported to be important to determine the catalytic activity of CO2RR. To synthesize Cu NPs around 20 nm size, 60 mg of copper (II) nitrate hydrate (Cu(NO3)2﹞xH2O; Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999 %) was dissolved in 10 mL of ethyleneglycol (EG; SigmaAldrich, 99.8 %) with vigorous stirring and this solution was heated to 120 ⊥ . Meanwhile, 20 mg of carbon (Ketjenblack, EC-300J) and 1 mg of cysteamine (SigmaAldrich, 95 %) were dispersed in 10 mL of EG by ultrasonication for 30 min. This carbon solution was injected to the copper precursor solution at 120 ⊥ and the mixed solution was kept stirring for 20 min before rising temperature up to the growth temperature. When the growth temperature was raised to 180 ⊥ and kept for 7 hours (denoted as Cu2O NP/C), cubic morphology was obtained. On the other hand, sphere morphology was grown at 220 ⊥ as the growth temperature, maintaining for 4 hours (denoted as Cu@CuO NP/C). In addition, the 2 ~ 4 nm sized Cu-based NP/C were synthesized at 200 ⊥ for 1 hour of growth time, and copper precursor amount was 20 mg. The ramping rate of the temperature was 3 ⊥/min for all the time. The product solution was cooled down naturally to room temperature and washed with isopropyl alcohol, filtered and dried. 2.2 Material Characterizations. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed with TitanTM 80-300 operated at 300 kV to observe the morphology of asprepared catalysts and their morphological changes after CO2RR. High resolution (HR) TEM images were also obtained to assign d-spacing of Cu NPs to understand the crystal structure. In addition, scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) mapping images of the post CO2 RR catalysts were obtained through Talos F200X 80-200 microscope operated at 200 kV. The crystal structure of as prepared catalysts was also analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker D8 Advance). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Thermo Scientific K-alpha) was used to investigate"

Finally, the vial was placed in an oil bath of 150 ～C for a certain period of time depending on the domain size (details in the Experimental Section). Figure 1 and 2 report the complete characterization of the synthesized Ag/Cu nanocrystals by various electron microscopy techniques, UV-vis extinction spectra and XRD. From TEM of the Ag-Cu NDs (Figure 1b), uniform calabash-like nanostructures are observed with two discrete spherical domains of distinct contrasts. Each domain is within the size range of 25-30 nm. HRTEM image (Figure 1e) shows a clear interface between the two domains, which are both multiply-twinned.40 HAADF-STEM (Figure 2a), which is sensitive to the atomic number of the specimen, confirms the presence of two domains containing different elements (i.e., Ag appears brighter than Cu), in the same nanocrystal. The corresponding EDX maps reveals a segregated distribution of Ag and Cu, suggesting that the higher- and lower-contrast domains are comprised of Ag and Cu, respectively. ICP-OES reports the mass ratio of Cu to Ag to be 1.1, consistent with the similar size of the two domains. This dimer is hereafter denoted as Ag1Cu1.1 NDs. As control samples, spherical Ag NPs (Figure 1c, f and Figure 2b) and Cu NPs (Figure 1d, g and Figure 2c) that have a similar size (25-30 nm) to the domains in the Ag1Cu1.1 NDs and contain multiple nanotwins (crystallite size around 10-15 nm) were also successfully produced, as demonstrated by the same electron microscopy techniques (TEM, STEM, EDX) as those applied for Ag1-Cu1.1 NDs. Consistent with the insights from the electron microscopy, the XRD pattern (Figure 2d) of the Ag1-Cu1.1 NDs show two distinct sets of diffraction peaks arising from the fcc structure of Ag and Cu, indicative of the formation of segregated pure metallic Cu and Ag phase in the dimer nanocrystals and discarding the idea of a AgCu alloy. Furthermore, the crystallite size for Cu and of Ag is found to be ~15 nm and ~12 nm, respectively, consistent with the TEM observation that the particles are multiply-twinned. The unique structural features of the NDs are reflected in their optical properties as well. As shown in the UV-visible spectra (Figure 2e), the bimetallic Ag1-Cu1.1 NDs exhibit two peaks"

After addition of this electrolyte, three cycles of cyclic voltammetry were performed from 0.9 to -1.05V vs. RHE at a rate of 5 mV/s. This high surface area structure was chosen in order to generate greater amounts of product and facilitate product detection. The cell was disassembled, the electrode was dried under N2 flow and solutions of the organic modifier were dropcast onto the Cu surface. Once dry, a solution of Nafion binder was dropcast onto the Cu surface. The electrode, once dry, was reassembled in the flow cell for electrochemical analyses. Chronoamperometry (CA) and product detection experiments: CA experiments were conducted in the cell with a CO2 flow rate of 5 sccm using a Biologic potentiostat (SP-300). Prior to CA experiments, linear scan voltammetry was conducted from the open circuit potential to -1.05V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 20 mV/s in order to reduce any oxidized Cu. The impedance was then measured and correction for the ohmic resistance was applied to the CA experiment as described in a reported procedure.30 Each trial was run at -0.7 V vs. RHE for 65 minutes. The outlet of the electrochemical cell was connected to an in-line gas chromatograph (GC), and the gaseous products were injected into the chromatograph at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after the beginning of the experiment. The average values from the four injections are reported. At the end of the experiment, the liquid from both the cathode and anode were analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to quantify the amount of formic acid produced, including formate that had diffused through the membrane during the experiment. Product selectivities and activities in terms of Faradaic efficiencies (%) and partial current densities (mA/cm2) are reported with error calculated via standard error of the mean and standard deviations; standard error of the mean is used in the main text. Measurement of the contact angle of water: Cu foil was electropolished, and the organic modifiers were dropcast onto the Cu foil at the same loadings as were used in the CA experiments. Once dry, the sample was placed on the goniometer, and 3 米L droplets of water were dropped onto the sample. The right and left angles of the droplet with the Cu surface were measured, and the average of at least five droplets is reported. ReaxFF MD simulation: All of the ReaxFF MD simulations were carried out using LAMMPS Molecular Dynamics Simulator. The force field parameters are supplied in the Supplementary Information.

Firstly, 1.8 g polyacrylonitrile (PAN, Mw=130000) powder was dissolved in 20 mL N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) in a three-neck bottle by magnetically stirring to obtain a homogenous solution. Then, 0.6 g of Cu/ZIF-8 nanoparticles were added in the PAN/DMF mixed solution and the compound was magnetically stirred to yield a homogenous precursor solution. The precursor solution was firstly moved into a syringe with a stainless needle at the tip, which is linked to a high voltage power equipment, and then electrospun to polymer fiber by a parallel-plate apparatus. The as-spun nanofibers were carbonized under Ar at 900 ～C for 1 hour, and the heating rate is 5 ～C/min from room temperature (about 20 ～C) after a pre- oxidated procedure in air at 220 ～C for 1 hour. After cooled to room temperature under Ar, the resultants were washed thoroughly in a 4.0 M H2SO4 aqueous solution for 10 hours to remove Cu nanoparticles (if exist) and the residual Zn species. After drying in vacuum at 60 oC overnight, CuSAs/TCNFs was thus obtained."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "In this work, morphologically and chemically well-defined ~5 nm CuZn nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized via inverse micelle encapsulation and used to investigate the correlation between their structure, composition, and electrocatalytic activity and selectivity. By means of quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and operando X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (XAFS), the evolution of the structure, chemical state and composition of the CuZn NPs was investigated under working CO2RR conditions. The gradual formation of a Cu-Zn alloy could be observed in the course of the CO2RR and correlated to the switch in selectivity from CH4 to CO. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of CuZn NPs Bimetallic CuZn nanoparticles (NPs) with the same nominal NP size but variable composition were prepared by an inverse micelle encapsulation method.47 The elemental composition was modified by controlling the molar ratio of the Cu and Zn precursor salts. CuCl2 and Zn(CH3COO)2 were dissolved in a solution of toluene and tetrahydrofuran, followed by the addition of a second toluene solution with a poly(styrene)block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) diblock copolymer (PS(48500)P2VP(70000), Polymer Source, Inc.). The mixture was then stirred for 2 days. The encapsulated CuZn NPs were deposited on glassy carbon substrates. After deposition, an O2-plasma etch treatment (20 W for 10 min, ~400 mTorr O2) was used to remove the polymeric ligands. The specific synthesis parameters of the seven samples used in this study can be found in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. 2.2. Morphological Characterization Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker, Multimode 8) was used to determine the NP height (hp). The CuZn NPs were deposited on silicon wafers for more accurate measurement of hp, since the glassy carbon electrode used for the electrochemical measurements has a rougher surface that makes difficult the background subtraction needed for the NP height determination. The average NP height was used to calculate the average CuZn geometric surface area of the NPs, ACuZn = 4羽(hp/2)2, assuming spherical micellar NPs. The metal NP surface area was then multiplied by the NP number density to estimate the total surface area of the CuZn NPs in each sample. This parameter was used for the normalization of the current data. 2.3. Electrochemical Characterization Electrochemical CO2 reduction experiments were conducted using an Autolab potentiostat (Multi Autolab M204) in an Htype two-compartment electrochemical cell made of polyether ether ketone (PEEK) separated by an anion-exchange membrane (Selemion AMV). A platinum mesh counter electrode and a leak-free Ag/AgCl reference electrode (Innovative Instruments) were used in a three electrode configuration. Purified 0.1 M KHCO3 solutions were prepared by treating the electrolyte with Chelex 100 Resin (Bio-Rad). The electrolyte was saturated with CO2 until a pH of 6.8 was achieved. Each data point presented corresponds to an identical freshly prepared sample measured with the chronoamperometric technique at -1.35 V vs. RHE."

The mixture was kept under the stirring condition for 120 min at room temperature. The product was collected by repeated ethanol wash and centrifugation for more than five times until the supernatant was colorless. The final product was lyophilized. XRD pattern of HKUST-1 powder is shown in Supplementary Fig. 12. [Cu(cyclam)]Cl2 synthesis. The preparation of [Cu(cyclam)]Cl2 is shown in Supplementary Note 3. The copper salt was used in slightly less amount (0.93 eq relative to cyclam), to ensure the complete consumption of copper ion, thus to ensure the absence of copper ion in the final product. The excess cyclam was removed by recrystallization from isopropanol. To synthesize [Cu(cyclam)]Cl2, A solution of 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam, 150 mg, 0.75 mmol) in ethanol (20 ml) was added CuCl2﹞2H2O (121 mg, 0.70 mmol, 0.93 eq) in one portion. The color changed immediately from colorless to purple. The resulting solution was stirred at 80 ～C under nitrogen atmosphere. After 5 h, the solution was cooled to room temperature and then filtered through a filter paper to remove the insoluble material, whereupon ethanol was removed by rotary evaporation. Isopropanol (~ 40 ml) was then added to the purple residue and the mixture was heated to reflux to completely dissolve the solid. The resulting purple solution was placed in a freezer (每 20 ～C) overnight, and the precipitated solid was collected by centrifugation and dried under high vacuum to afford [Cu(cyclam)]Cl2 (228 mg, 90% yield) as a purple powder.

To assess the influence of OD Cu on the diffusion of indium, an additional set of electrodes was prepared by depositing indium islands on a substrate whose initial Cu2O layer had been previously reduced. To this end, a 4-inch wafer was first processed as previously described to produce a Cu2O substrate. A large puncture-resistant polypropylene container (Braun Medibox) with a total volume of 3 dm3 served as a one-compartment cell for the electrochemical reduction of the Cu2O layer. The wafer was placed vertically in the cell with a Teflon wafer holder and the cell was filled with sufficient electrolyte (CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3) to fully submerge the substrate. CO2 was continuously bubbled into the electrolyte at a flow rate of 20 cm3 STPmin?1. A large carbon gas diffusion layer (Sigracet 39BC, SGL Carbon) placed in close proximity (ca. 1 cm) and parallel to the substrate served as the counter electrode. Electrical contact with the working and counter electrodes was achieved with conductive copper foil tape (3M). The leak-free Ag/AgCl reference electrode (3.4 M KCl, model LF-1, Innovative Instruments) was placed in the interelectrode space. The Cu2O layer was reduced under similar conditions to the CO2 reduction tests by holding the potential at ?0.6 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for 5 min. Cu2O was fully reduced within 2 min to form a homogeneous oxide-derived copper layer, as confirmed by visual inspection and SEM analysis. The OD Cu substrate was then rinsed copiously with DI water and subsequent processing (e.g., photolithography, deposition of indium islands) was performed in the same manner as with a regular Cu wafer, as described."

The two solutions were then mixed and stirred overnight. The nanocrystals gradually transferred to NMF. The bottom phase was extracted and washed with hexane three times. The N3?-capped Cu3N nanocrystals were then precipitated out using chloroform as the anti-solvent. The precipitate was dried in vacuum for 15 min and then stored. In the ligand exchange process, we deliberately exposed the materials to ambient air to introduce an oxide layer at the surface of Cu3N nanocrystals."

The electrochemical deposition of metallic hydroxide was carried out in a neutral electrolyte containing the corresponding metallic nitrate as the precursor35 (Supplementary Fig. 2). A cathodic current was first applied to the Cu/PTFE electrode to generate OH? from nitrate reduction. The metallic hydroxide was then deposited onto the Cu surface via chemical reaction between the metallic cation and locally-generated OH?. During the electrochemical deposition, the color of the Cu surface turned to brown."

Since the Cu and Sn can be easily oxidized at ambient conditions, a concentrated strong reduction solution (5M NaBH4) was used to ensure the completed reduction. For the preparation of the Cu100 sample, 2 mL CuCl2 (300 mg) aqueous solution was rapidly added into 2 mL NaBH4 solution under ice bath and aged for 0.5 h. The asprepared black suspension was then washed with H2O and acetone several times. After drying in vacuum at room temperature, the Cu100 nanoparticles were obtained. For the synthesis of Cu99Sn1 and Cu97Sn3, 4.1 mg and 12.3 mg SnCl2 was added into 2 mL CuCl2 (300 mg) solution, respectively, before further react with NaBH4. For the preparation of the Cu70Sn30 sample, 300 mg CuCl2 and 170.2 mg SnCl2 were added into 3.2 mL H2O and then react with NaBH4. After synthesis, all the samples were stored under vacuum at room temperature to avoid oxidation for further use. The ratio of Sn and Cu in alloys were calculated from the stoichiometry of the precursor metals in the chemical reduction process."

Due to the large amount of graphite on the surface of nanodiamond seeds, the surface was oxidized by heating in air at 500 ～C for 1.5 h with carboxylation in concentrated H2SO4每HNO3 (3:1, v/v) at 100 ～C for 3 d. Through a sequence of oxidation and strong acid treatment, nanodiamond seeds were redissolved in water solution at a concentration of 1 mg ml?1. Ultrasound sonication of the Si wafer with nanodiamond slurry for 30 min was adequate to achieve the highly efficient and uniform deposition of nanodiamond seeding onto the surface of the substrate. Then, the wafer was baked at 120 ～C for 30 min before being placed into the CVD growth chamber. The nitrogen-doped nanodiamond films were synthesized using microwave plasma CVD (MPCVD, Seki Diamond Systems SDS 5010). The plasma was generated by microwave radiation of 2.45 GHz and the power was 1,300 W. The silicon wafer (thickness, ~550每600 米m; resistivity, ~0.001每0.005 次cm) was placed in the CVD chamber on a molybdenum holder. The working pressure was at 40 Torr. The flow rates of methane (CH4), nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) were 10 sccm, ~0每25 sccm and 300 sccm, respectively. The molybdenum stage was heated to 540 ～C and all of the growth times were 2 h. After growth, the substrate temperature was cooled down to room temperature with hydrogen gas. The copper nanoparticles were sputtered on top of the N-ND film using an AJA International Sputtering System (AJA International). The argon plasma was ignited using an external planar antenna (also known as a transformer coupled plasma antenna) connected to a (13.56 MHz) RF power generator. The substrate was placed on a movable 25-cm2 square substrate holder and was parallel to the Cu target (50 ℅ 50 ℅ 0.1 mm3). The distance between the target and the substrate was about 25 cm. The base pressure in the deposition chamber was below 2 ℅ 10?5 Torr. A gun power of 150 W and a pressure of 15 ℅ 10?3 Torr were used."

Cu films grown on Si(100) and Si(110) wafers yield Cu orientations of (100) and (111), respectively. The native oxide on the Si wafers was first removed via a HF etch and subsequent growth of the films was carried out using sputtering with an AJA International ATC Orion 5 sputtering system. In all cases, the thicknesses of the Cu films were controlled at 200 nm thick using a quartz crystal monitor. Samples were kept in a N2-filled glove box when not in use to minimize oxidation in ambient air. The orientations were also confirmed according to similar procedures reported by Koper and co-workers48 as well as Yeo and co-workers32. Briefly, this was accomplished with cyclic voltammetry in Arsparged 0.1 M KOH solution in the potential range of ? 1.3 V to ? 0.45 V versus Ag/ AgCl at a rate of 120 mV s?1. The OH? adsorption and desorption peaks are unique and depend on the Cu surface and thus may be used to identify and confirm its orientation. Cyclic voltammetry was also carried out after CO reduction to confirm that loss of the surface orientation did not occur (Supplementary Fig. 33)."

The foil was then thermally annealed in air using a muffle furnace at a temperature of 500 ～C for 30 min to convert Cu(OH)2 into CuO. The muffle furnace was then allowed to cool to room temperature before the Cu foils were removed."

The back side of GDL substrate was fixed to a micro glass slide with double-sided tape, giving one-sided deposition of Cu. Pt wire was used as the counter-electrode. A leakless Ag/AgCl (eDAQ) electrode was used as the reference electrode. Before electrodeposition, the GDL was pretreated by sputtering 10 nm of Cu using an AJA Orion-8 Magnetron Sputtering System.

The resulting mixture was then mixed with a superheated water feed at 400 ～C (via pump 1 at 80 mL min-1) inside a confined jet mixer, (CJM) (Fig. 1). This CJM was designed to mix the reagents without blockages under a turbulent mixing regime (Reynolds number ＞ 6079). The calculated mixing temperature was ca. 305 ～C, with a residence time of ca. 0.6 s before the nanoparticle slurry was quenched rapidly as it mixed with a feed of room temperature deionised water (via pump 4 at 160 mL min-1) in a second CJM (Reynolds number ＞ 2989). The design and sizes of the two CJMs are given in more detail in the supplementary information and in previous publications.30 The newly formed and partially cooled nanoparticle laden slurry was then cooled further via a pipe-in-pipe heat exchanger and was then continuously collected from the exit of the back-pressure regulator (BPR), which maintained the pressure in the system at 24.1 MPa. The particle slurry was cleaned via dialysis and repeated centrifugation until the conductivity of the slurry was <50 米S, as measured by a conductivity probe (Hanna Instruments HI98311, Bedfordshire UK). The concentrated slurry was then freeze-dried with slow heating from -40 ～C to 25 ～C using a VirTis Genesis 35 XL Lyophilizer at ca. 10-7 MPa for 24 hours."

All electrolysis experiments in this work were controlled by a CHI660E potentiostat (CH Instruments). Electrodeposition was carried out at the potential of -1.08V (aqueous KCl-saturated Ag/AgCl) at 75 ⊥ for 20 min with Pt mesh as counter electrode, during which the bath was continuously stirred at a speed of 110 rpm. Then the prepared Cu-Ni nanocones electrode was washed with copious of deionized water and dried under vacuum overnight. Finally, the Cu nanocones catalyst was obtained by immersing Cu-Ni nanocones into 0.1 M H2SO4 for an hour to dealloy the nickel."

Similarly, 1.7mmol BEN was dissolved in another 9 mL mixture and designated as solution B. Then solution B was slowly injected into the solution A followed by 15 min stirring at 90 ～C to obtain a light blue former solution C. After that, 0.1 mmol 1, 3, 5- benzotriacetic acid (BTC) was added into ethanol (9 mL)/DMF (9 mL) mixture to form a transparent solution D. Subsequently, Solution D was added to former solution C and stirred for 6 h at 90 ～C. The BEN modified Cu-BTC MOFs was collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol at least 6 times, and dried at 60 ～C. The dried BEN-Cu-BTC MOFs were annealed at 200, 300, 350, 400, 600 and 800 ～C for 1.5 h with a heating rate of 1 ～C/min under Ar atmosphere, respectively. (Caution: An enough degassing time should be adopted to ensure that all the air adsorbed by the huge surface area MOFs was evacuated by pump). After cooling to room temperature, the Ar supply were stopped, and the flange cover were opened to let products slowly expose to air overnight for passivation treatment. After that, the black powders were collected, washed twice with water and dried at 60 ～C, the final products were recorded as Cu-NC200, Cu-NC300, Cu-NC350, Cu-NC400, Cu-NC600 and Cu-NC800, respectively."

Then, the solution was ultrasonically dispersed with 50 mg carbon black with vigorous magnetic stirring for at least 1 h, which resulted in a 40 wt% loading of metal in total weight. As a reducing agent, lithium triethylborohydride (4 mL) was injected into the dispersion. During the reaction, the flask containing the solution was held in a water bath at 50 ～C, which was key to the formation of the ordered Cu and Sn intermetallic structure. In addition, bimetallic Cu每Sn was also prepared using the same procedure but without a water bath as a comparison. After being held in the water bath for one night, the dispersion was centrifuged, washed with hexane several times, and dried under vacuum at 25 ～C. The obtained powder was sealed in a Cu tube under an argon atmosphere and annealed at 150 ～C. The annealed powder was used as an electrocatalyst for the subsequent experiments. Cu NP/CB and Sn NP/CB were synthesized by similar procedures."

Then, a nominal amount (20 wt%) of Cu(NO3)2﹞xH2O was added into the above mixture and stirred. Then, the resulting homogeneous suspension was placed in a microwave oven (KR-M202BMP, DAEWOO) at a power of 350 W for 3 min and cooled down to room temperature. The obtained black powder was washed several times using acetone and distilled water to remove the residue of ethylene glycol. Final products were then dried in a freezing dryer and denoted as Cu/PC, Cu/NPC-700, Cu/NPC-800 and Cu/NPC-900. In the meantime, the control samples with different Cu mass loadings of 10 and 30 wt% were also synthesized by adjusting the amounts of Cu 72 | Green Chem., 2020, 22, 71每84 This journal is ?

First, Sn nanoparticles were grown on Cu foam by an electrodeposition process. In detail, a piece of Cu foam (10 mm 12 mm 1.6 mm, 780 g m 2, Suzhou Taili Materials, China) was pretreated in a 5 M HCl aqueous solution for 30 min to remove any potential copper oxide species on the surface, and then rinsed with deionized water. Sn was then deposited onto the treated Cu foam in a three-electrode cell, with Cu foam as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, in a 2 M KOH aqueous solution containing 0.05 M SnCl2. A constant current of 5 mA cm 2 was applied for varied periods (1000, 2000, and 3000 s) at ambient temperature. A total charge of 5C, 10C or 15C was used for Sn reduction and deposition. The obtained samples, denoted as Cu@Sn5, Cu@Sn10 and Cu@Sn15, respectively, were rinsed with ethanol and dried in N2. Thermal annealing of the samples at 300 C for 3 h in a nitrogen atmosphere resulted in the formation of heterostructured CuSn"

During electrodeposition, the Cu(II) in the lactate complex is reduced to Cu(I), which forms insoluble Cu2O on the electrode surface.30,31 Ni was then electrodeposited on top of Cu2O chronopotentiometrically at -4 mA/cm2 as reported by Lee et al.21 By varying the electrodeposition time (10 s, 20 s, 100 s, 160 s, 200 s, and 500 s), the thickness of the Ni overlayer can be tuned (Table 1).

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Materials and Chemicals. The Cu foil (99.99% pure) was purchased from Goodfellow (initial dimension 10 cm ℅ 10 cm) and cut into pieces measuring 8 mm  25 mm. The Cu foils served as substrates for catalyst preparation by means of hydrogen bubble assisted alloy electrodeposition. Na2PdCl4 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) and CuSO4  5 H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) served as metal precursors for the plating step. KHCO3 (ACS grade) and K2SO4 (ACS grade) were purchased 5 from Sigma Aldrich. ACS grade H2SO4 (Sigma) was used to prepare the plating bath. All chemicals were used without further purification. Milli-Q water (Millipore, 18.2 M次 cm, 4 ppb of total organic carbon content) was used for the preparation of all solutions. Catalyst preparation: Prior to alloy electrodeposition the Cu foil substrate was electropolished in 50% phosphoric acid (ACS grade, Sigma Aldrich) to remove the native oxide layer from its surface. For this pre-treatment step, a two electrode arrangement that consisted of a graphite foil and the Cu foil serving as cathode and anode, respectively, was used. A potential difference of 2.0 V was applied for 2 min. After electropolishing, the Cu foil was thoroughly rinsed in Milli-Q water, subsequently sonicated in ethanol for 15 mins, and finally dried in air before use. To obtain a well-defined geometric surface area of 1 cm2 the Cu foil substrate was masked with an insulating PTFE tape. Unless otherwise stated, alloy deposition was carried out using a plating bath containing Na2PdCl4 and CuSO4  5 H2O metal ion sources (1:9 ratio, 25 mM) in 1.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte (pH ~ 0.5). A three-electrode arrangement, consisting of a Pt foil (4 cm  3 cm, counter electrode), an Ag/AgCl3M reference electrode (Metrohm), and the Cu foil substrate serving as the working electrode, was used for electrodeposition. A constant current density of -3 A/cm2 was applied for 40 s. After deposition, the formed metal foams were gently rinsed with Milli-Q water to remove excess electrolyte. For the majority of the CO2 electrolysis experiments the PdCu foam catalyst were further activated by 12 h of thermal annealing in air at a temperature of 200 ～C using a tube furnace (GERO, GmbH, Germany). Catalyst activation was completed by an electrochemical reduction of the formed oxidic precursor in CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 solution for 45 min at an applied potential of -0.65 V vs. RHE. The individual steps of the catalyst preparation and activation procedure are schematically shown in Figure 1. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the as-deposited as well as the activated PdCu foam catalysts was determined based on voltammetric measurements using di-methyl viologen as a reversible redox probe. This procedure has been described in detail elsewhere.7 CO2 electrolysis experiments. All electrochemical measurements were carried out using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm Autolab 128N, The Netherlands). Prior to the electrolysis experiments, the cell resistance was measured by means of impedance spectroscopy. All potentials reported herein are iR-corrected. The CO2RR was carried out at room temperature using a custom-made H-type glass cell where the two compartments were separated by a cation exchange membrane (Nafion 117, Electrochem, USA). Aqueous 0.5 M KHCO3 solution was 6 used as electrolyte. A leakless Ag/AgCl3M (EDAQ) served as the reference electrode, a Pt foil (15 mm ℅ 5 mm, 99.95%, Alfa Aesar) was used as the counter (anode), and the CuPd foam catalyst served as the working electrode (cathode). Prior to commencing CO2 electrolysis, both the anolyte and the catholyte were purged with CO2 (99.9999%, Carbagas, Switzerland) at a flow rate of ~30 mL min-1 at least for 30 mins. During the electrolysis, the catholyte was constantly purged with CO2 at a flow rate of ~13 mL min-1. The headspace of the cathode compartment was approximately 12 mL. For the sake of comparability, all potentials, recorded versus the Ag/AgCl3M electrode, were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the following equation: ERHE (V) = EAg/AgCl3M (V) + 0.210 V + (0.0591 V * pH) The quantification of the gaseous and non-gaseous reaction products by means of gaschromatography and ion-exchange chromatography is described elsewhere.7 26 According to the post-electrolysis inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, Pt was detected neither in the separated catholyte compartment nor on the catalyst surface. Any interference of Pt dissolution at the anode during electrolysis can thus be excluded. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. XRD analyses of the as prepared (ap), thermally annealed (ta), and oxide-derived (od) PdCu catalysts were carried out by means of powder XRD (Bruker D8) using CuK汐 radiation (竹 = 0.1540 nm, 40 mA) generated at 40 keV. Scans were recorded at 1～ min每1 for 2牟 values ranging from 20 to 90～. The obtained XRD patterns were analyzed and compared with JCPD (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction) standards for different pure metals, bimetallic alloy materials (Cu, Pd, and CuPd alloy) and corresponding oxide phases (CuO, Cu2O, CuPdO3). An activated carbon foil was used as the substrate for all XRD analyses to avoid undesirable contributions of the substrate to the XRD pattern of the PdCu alloy sample of interest. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). The morphology and composition of the as-deposited and oxide-derived CuPd catalysts were studied by means of a FE Zeiss DSM 982 SEM instrument equipped with a Noran SIX NSS200 energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. XPS studies were performed by means of Al-K汐 radiation sources which was operated at 150W with an Omicron Multiprobe (Omicron Nano Technology) 7 spectrometer coupled to an EA 125 (Omicron) hemi-spherical analyzer. C1s peak was used as reference and the fitting was performed using CasaXPS software. Note that, the samples were used for the XPS analyses without any further modifications (e.g. metal sputtering). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and high-angle annular darkfield scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). HR-TEM and HAADFSTEM were carried out by a Thermo Scientific Talos F200X G2 TEM (FEI, operating voltage 200kV). For these measurements, the catalyst materials were gently removed from the Cu foil substrate, dispersed in ethanol by sonication, and subsequently drop-casted on a carbon coated Ni grid (300 mesh). Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The bulk elemental composition has been studied by ICP-OES analysis (Thermo Scientific iCAP 7400 ICP-OES DUO). The PdCu metal foams have been dissolved in 30% HNO3 for ICP-OES analysis. The time-dependent monitoring of the electrolyte chemical composition (metal content) has been carried out using a NexION 2000 ICP-MS instrument (Perkin Elmer). Operando Raman spectroscopy. Details of the operando Raman spectroscopy have been described elsewhere.43 The spectroscopic analysis was conducted by means of a LabRAM HR800 confocal microscope (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Spectral data were collected with Lab Space 3.0 software. A large working distance objective lens (50 X magnification, 8 mm focal length) has been applied with a numerical aperture of 0.1 in order to focus a diode-pumped solid-state laser beam (excitation wavelength 633 nm, DPSS laser, power 3 mW) on the sample and collect the incident and scattered laser light. A home-made spectro-electrochemical cell made of Kel-F was used for the spectro-electrochemical experiments. The spectro-electrochemical cell consisted of a Ag/AgCl reference (EDAQ) electrode whereas a Au-wire served as the counter electrode. A 米Autolab III (EcoChemie) potentiostat was used for the electrochemical Raman measurements. Raman spectra were collected in the spectral range from 100 - 2500 cm-1 at 3 mW laser power. For the data acquisition during the potentiostatic experiments the holding time was 120 s at each applied electrolysis potential."

Firstly, Cu Np was synthesized on cleaned electropolished copper foil by an electrodeposition method (for more information, see the experimental section). During the electrodeposition, Cu2+ in the electrolyte was reduced to metallic Cu at the Cu foil surface and deposited to form Cu nanopores via the electrocrystallization process. Subsequently, Ag NPs were embedded on the surface of Cu Np by the in situ reduction method using silver nitrate as the Ag source. It is worth noting that although Ag+ could be reduced to metallic Ag by Cu through the displacement reaction (Cu0 + 2Ag+ ↙ Cu2+ + 2Ag), ascorbic acid was necessary to be added into the solution as a reducing agent to reduce Ag+ and Cu2+ in the vicinity of Cu nanopores into metallic ones. Zn@Cu Np was prepared in the same manner except that zinc nitrate hexahydrate was used as a zinc source during the reduction process."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "The CuO nanostructures as the Cu catalyst precursor were facilely synthesized by microwave heating CuCl2 dissolved in 3 M KOH solution as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The microwave power determines the morphology of CuO nanostructures, i.e., nanowires versus nanoplatelets (Fig. 1b, c and Fig. S1, ESI?). At a low power of 200 W, the obtained CuO-1 sample exhibited a uniform structure of nanowires with an average diameter of 20 nm (Fig. 1b). The nanowires became wider, accompanied by the formation of some nanoplatelets when the microwave power was increased to 300 W (CuO-2, Fig. S1a, ESI?). CuO nanoplatelets prevailed over nanowires as the power was increased to 400 W (CuO-3, Fig. S1b, ESI?). Further increasing the power to 500 W, pure CuO nanoplatelets were obtained, which had a lateral size of 150每300 nm and thickness of 30每50 nm (CuO-4, Fig. 1c). The crystalline structures of these four CuO samples were confirmed by XRD patterns (Fig. S2, ESI?). TEM images in the inset of Fig. 1d and e demonstrated the pure nanowires and nanoplatelets structures of CuO-1 and CuO-4, respectively. The corresponding high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images showed clear lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.275 nm for both CuO-1 and CuO-4, which was referred to the CuO(110) facets. The selective electron diffraction pattern suggests the single-crystal structure of CuO (Fig. S3, ESI?). The CuO-1 nanowires and CuO-4 nanoplatelets also exhibited a similar surface chemical state of exclusive Cu2+ as reflected by the XPS analysis of Cu 2p (Fig. S4a, ESI?), O 1s (Fig. S4b, ESI?), and Cu LMM (Fig. S4c, ESI?).12,22 No K element was found in the CuO samples (Fig. S5, ESI?)."

Firstly, an oxide-derived Cu nanorod sample (Cu-nr) was prepared via the electroreduction of CuO nanorods. Another OD-Cu catalyst was prepared via the simple redox cycling treatment of Cu-nr. Cu-nr oxide (Cu-nr-O) was prepared via the oxidation of Cu-nr in 1.0 M KOH solution, then, reduced Cu-nr-O (Cu-nr-OR) was obtained via the electroreduction of Cu-nr-O (Fig. S1?). The obtained Cu-nr had a diameter of about 40 nm (Fig. S2?), and exhibited a crosslinked architecture. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies suggested that Cu-nr-OR also exhibited nanorod morphology, which was similar to Cu-nr (Fig. 1A and B). The diameters of Cu-nr and Cunr-OR were about 40 nm. From high-resolution TEM images (Fig. 1C and S3?), the corresponding lattice spacings of CuO (001), Cu2O (111), Cu2O (110), and Cu (111) were observed for Cu-nr-OR, which may be because Cu can be oxidized by air before measurements. In addition, a small amount of Cu2O can also be observed based on powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Fig. S4?). Furthermore, we can nd that Cu-nr-OR comprised a lot of nanocrystals, and abundant interfaces between the nanocrystals were produced. Similar interfaces were found in Cu-nr (Fig. S5?), albeit the density of interfaces is signicantly lower than that in Cu-nr-OR. This may be due to the size of the nanocrystals in Cu-nr being about twice that in Cu-nr-OR. Also, Cu nanoparticles (Cu-np) with a diameter of 50 nm were selected as a contrasting material. We can observe that Cu-np mostly exhibited single facets with few interfaces (Fig. S6?). These results indicated that OD-Cu exhibited abundant interfaces, which was consistent with previous reports.21每23"

As the amount of Ce in the catalysts increased from 0 to 30%, a set of peaks belonging to the CeO2 phase gradually emerged on the base of the primary CuO phase in the X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. 1a), indicating the coexistence of CeO2 and CuO in the catalysts, and the CeO2/ CuO catalysts were named CCX (X ? the molar ratio of Ce and Cu times 100). From scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we can observe that CeO2 nanoparticles below 5 nm were evenly loaded on the surface of CuO (Fig. 1b, c and S2?). Two typical d-spacings of 0.31 nm and 0.23 nm were observed in the image of highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) for CC20 (Fig. 1d), corresponding to CeO2(111) and CuO(111). According to the distribution of the elements of Cu, Ce and O in the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy maps (Fig. 1e), the uniform element dispersion of Cu and Ce over the catalyst conrmed that CeO2 was uniformly dispersed on the CuO."

The calcined copper oxide hollow fibers were subsequently treated at 200, 250, 280, 330, 360, or 400 ?C for 1 h in a flow of H2/Ar containing 4 vol-% H2, using a heating rate of 1.5 K min?1. The fibers were cooled in H2-atmosphere, and passivated by slow oxidation of the surface against the laboratory atmosphere at room temperature. This way, a variety of copper hollow fibers was obtained."

Sodium citrate (1.471 M, 20 mL) dropwise was then added to the solution and stirred. Cu2+ was reduced by dropwise addition of hydrazine hydrate (50%, 5 mL) with vigorous stirring at room temperature. After gently stirring the solution overnight, the mixture was centrifuged, washed with distilled water, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 ?C for 4 h. Samples with Cu loadings of 5, 10, 20, 60, and 80 wt % were obtained by changing the amount of TiO2, while pure Cu NPs was prepared without addition of TiO2.

This powder was then pressed into a 50 mm diameter disk, annealed at 200 ?C under Ar, and slowly cooled to ambient temperature. The Cu6Sn5 target was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and was shown to correspond to the expected 灰-Cu6Sn5 (C2/c) monoclinic phase formed at low temperatures with lattice parameters a = 11.0262 (㊣0.0014) ?, b = 7.2745 (㊣0.0012) ?, and c = 9.846 (㊣0.0021) ? [22]. The Cu6Sn10 target was a mixture of Sn and the Cu6Sn5 monoclinic phase. Thin film depositions were carried out using direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering of the above alloyed targets in argon plasma onto (2000-grit) polished nickel foils. Sputtering was conducted at 10 W, 20 mTorr, and with a 5 cm target每substrate distance. This resulted in a deposition rate of about 0.9 nm s?1 and yielded thin films with the structure of the high temperature hexagonal Cu6Sn5 (P63/mmc, ICDD 00-002-0713) phase [22] and Cu6Sn10 was a mixture of Sn (I4/mmm, ICDD 96-900-8571) and the 灰-Cu6Sn5 phase (see Results and Discussion). Film thicknesses were systematically varied between 0.1 and 0.5 mm."

        "synthesis_paragraph": "Copper thin film was prepared by electrodeposition in an aqueous electrolyte composed of 0.25 M copper sulfate solution and 50 mM sulfuric acid. NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) was a typical smart metal that could remember its original shape after deformation, when heated, due to its reversible martensitic transformation [24]. A near-equiatomic NiTi sheet, sized of 10 mm ℅ 10 mm ℅ 1 mm, was used as the substrate for electrodepostion due to its negligible CO2RR activity and good chemical stability in the electrolyte. In addition, in our later work, the two-way shape memory effect of NiTi [25] was used to induce elastic strain to Cu nanofilm and study the strain effect [26] on the CO2 reduction reaction of Cu. A three-electrode cell including NiTi as working electrode, Pt mesh as counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (1M Cl?) as reference electrode was used. All potentials reported in this paper are quoted with Ag/AgCl. The polycrystalline Cu film was deposited at room temperature by chronoamperometry at ?0.34 V. After 300 s deposition, the electrode was taken out and rinsed gently with deionized water several times."

The compositions of AunCu100?n NPs were controlled by adjusting the ratios of Cu NPs and HAuCl4. The morphology and alloy structure of the AunCu100?n NPs were obtained by TEM and HRTEM. The compositions of the AunCu100?n NPs were controlled by the metal precursor ratios and analyzed by ICP-MS, indicating that the compositions of the AunCu100?n NPs can be controlled well by tuning the feeding ratio during the synthesis. It can be seen in Figure 1 that the diameter of Au25Cu75 NPs was 10每16 nm (Figure 1a), that of Au50Cu50 NPs was 8每12 nm (Figure 1b) and that of Au75Cu25 NPs was 6每10 nm, via TEM (Figure 1c). It can be concluded from the TEM images that with the increase in Au content in AunCu100?n alloy NPs, the diameter of AunCu100?n alloy NPs gradually decreased. HR-TEM images revealed that AunCu100?n NPs are a dominant (111) facet and the continuous lattice fringes of AunCu100?n NPs calculated were slightly smaller than those of the pure Au (0.235 nm) and larger than that of pure Cu (0.208 nm), indicating that Au successfully replaced Cu to form AuCu alloy catalysts, as shown in Figure 1d每f. The AunCu100?n alloyed structure was also achieved by the elemental mapping technique (Figure 1g每i) [32], which showed that Au and Cu were evenly distributed in the AunCu100?n NPs."

Then, 2 mL of the Triton X-100 was added into it drop wise followed by stirring for 40 min. Then 0.5 M solution of ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3) was added in the solution drop wise and stirred up to 40 min at 60 ?C. In order to maintain the pH of the solution between pH 10每11, 1 M solution of NaOH was added drop wise followed by stirring of the solution up to 1.5 h at 90 ?C. The precipitate was then centrifuged at 13,000℅ g rpm and washed several times with deionized water and ethanol. CuO nanoparticles were then dried at 80 ?C over night and followed by grinding the precipitates into fine powder. 2.1.3. Preparation of Glassy Carbon Plate/Electrodes"

Subsequently, the solution was sonicated for 30min and stirred for 4 h. After pH of the solution was adjusted to 8.5 with 0.1M Na2CO3, 10mL of 50mM NaBH4 was slowly added to the solution and stirred for an additional 1 h. Finally, the mixture was washed, filtered and dried at 50～C for 12 h. Other catalysts with different atomic ratios of Pd and Cu were prepared in the similar manner except that the components of the initial solution were different."
